<p style="font-weight:bold; color:#3366FF; padding-top:10px;">This will be the club shirt that everyone will be wearing next year and we'll be selling to next year's new members!</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">This shirt will cost ~$15. Interested? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ChakJ1LnTo0nmA3XUsiLMUgWmZaGrFk4GCq4nbxL7M0/viewform">Order here!</a></p>

<p style="font-weight:bold padding-bottom:10px;";>But we will also be reordering the club shirt from 3 years ago because it was a great design and some people wanted to get it.</p>

<p><strong>If you're thinking "Hmmm, which shirt should I get?" why not get both?</strong> Sure it might seem like a lot of money, but I assure you that these are good quality tshirts with great designs, and it's nice to have shirts from clubs. We will try to order some extras in case you decide you want a shirt after we place the order, but <strong><span style="color:#FF0000;">we cannot guarantee that you will be able to purchase one later on, so order them now!</span> This is especially true for the 2nd design!</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; color:#29A329;">Also, the more people who order shirts, the cheaper they will be! So if a lot of people order, they can be a couple dollars cheaper!</p>
