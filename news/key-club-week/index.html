        <h2>Fun Fact: When someone asks a Key Clubber "How do you feel?!", he/she has to respond with "I feel good! Oh I feel so good! Oh!" -pelvic thrust-</h2>
        <p>Why do we feel you need to know this?! We have a very special week to look forward to because it's Key Club Week from November 4-8! Key Club Week gives you the opportunity to show your community what Key Club is truly about: service. Each day places an emphasis on service, to promote Key Club within our homes, schools and communities and to make Key Club a household name.</p>
        <p>Throughout the week, we encourage you to spread the word about Key Club! You can wear your Key Club apparel, paste a sticker on your backpack saying "Ask me about Key Club" or "Ask me how I feel", ask a fellow Key Clubber "How do you feel?!", recruit a friend to the club, the possibilities are endless! Throughout November 4-8, send in pictures/videos of yourself/other Key Clubbers doing any of the above or going about their own creative ways of spreading Key Club. Each good quality and non-repetitive picture/video that you send to us will earn you points!</p>
        <p>As a treat, the cabinet members will be giving candy to whoever we see rocking their Key Club apparel throughout the week! So stalk us out!</p>
        <p>On Friday November 8, we will be holding a party in <strong>room 335</strong>. We may go over some upcoming Key Club events and talk a bit about Key Club Week, but the majority of the time will be spent eating food and playing icebreakers. It will definitely be a great way to have some fun, bond with Key Club members, and celebrate the end to Key Club Week!</p>
        <p class="lead">We will also be collecting <a href="/news/trick-or-treat-unicef">UNICEF boxes</a> for those of you who have them!</p>
