## Fun Fact: When someone asks a Key Clubber "How do you feel?!", he/she has to respond with "I feel good! Oh I feel so good! Oh!" -pelvic thrust-

Why do we feel you need to know this?! We have a very special week to look forward to because it's Key Club Week from November 4-8! Key Club Week gives you the opportunity to show your community what Key Club is truly about: service. Each day places an emphasis on service, to promote Key Club within our homes, schools and communities and to make Key Club a household name.

Throughout the week, we encourage you to spread the word about Key Club! You can wear your Key Club apparel, paste a sticker on your backpack saying "Ask me about Key Club" or "Ask me how I feel", ask a fellow Key Clubber "How do you feel?!", recruit a friend to the club; the possibilities are endless! Throughout November 4-8, send in pictures/videos of yourself/other Key Clubbers doing any of the above or going about their own creative ways of spreading Key Club. Each good quality and non-repetitive picture/video that you send to us will earn you points!

As a treat, the cabinet members will be giving candy to whoever we see rocking their Key Club apparel throughout the week! So stalk us out!

On Friday November 8, we will be holding a party at a room TBA. We may go over some upcoming Key Club events and talk a bit about Key Club Week, but the majority of the time will be spent eating food and playing icebreakers. It will definitely be a great way to have some fun, bond with Key Club members, and celebrate the end to Key Club Week!

**We will also be collecting [UNICEF boxes](/news/trick-or-treat-unicef) for those of you who have them!**
