This year, elections will be held towards the end of January. But before that, there are logistical things that must be taken care of!  
We will be having an Officer Training Conference (OTC) before elections so that you can learn more about the various positions. This conference is mandatory for anyone wishing to run for a position. *Not sure what you want to run for just yet?* At the [bottom of this page](#positions), brief descriptions of the tasks of each position are listed.

To **vote**, you must be an official Key Club member (paid your $13 dues) and have at least 10 hours by the date of election.

To **run**, you must be an official Key Club member (paid your $13 dues), have at least 20 hours by the date of election, attend the Officer Training Conference, and score a minimum of 70% on the Key Club test. The Key Club test is a tradition that we have done each year to determine the order of the candidates' speeches. This is the first year we are implementing a minimum score, but like every other year, we will send out a study sheet to the candidates with enough time in advance so they can study. The test is straightforward and if you actually put time into studying, you should have no problem getting a good grade, never mind a 70%.

- **President**: "The club president plans, organizes, and carries out responsibilities associated with the club's chief executive officer role. He/she must preside over club meetings, hold regular board meetings and delegate tasks to the board. The president acts as a liaison between the club's board, the school, the lieutenant governor, the sponsoring Kiwanis club, and other club presidents.

- **Vice President**: "As vice president, there are three important duties to complete. For one, the vice president watches over the committee system by delegating tasks to the committee chairs and attending all their meetings as an advisor. Secondly, he/she makes sure that all the proper paperwork is submitted on time every month. This paperwork is different from that submitted by the secretary; the more important forms include LTG Evaluation Forms, club emails, and the Annual Achievement Report, which the secretary will be helping with. Last but not least, he/she must help the president organize each club and board meeting and regularly attend these meetings as well as events. In general, the vice president should communicate with members to get them more involved, work to ensure the recruitment and retention of members, help the president, and act as a role model for the club. I will go into specifics at the officer training conference." - Wendy Huang
