title: Library Tutoring
---
<p>Every Saturday, Stuyvesant students from the different boroughs of New York City travel to a local New York Public Library, where they volunteer to tutor children in grades K-8. Just go to the location, find a group of Stuyvesant-looking students (there will probably be posters/signs), and tell them you're from Stuyvesant Key Club. If you sign up to be project captain, send us a PRF once a month with the cumulative hours! You will not need to submit a PRF every week!
</p>

<p><b>Sign up for all library branches <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/IQGxnPZ9dn">here</a></b></p>

<p>Note: Working Papers are required to volunteer at a Queens Library Branch</p>
