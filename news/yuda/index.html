<p>We are going to be selling Yuda Bands, each wrist band costing $7, to fundraise money towards children education in Guatemla. Each volunteer for a specific time slot will be responsible for retrieving the bands from our Key Club locker at the beginning of the period, as well as, putting it back before the period is over. <b>Volunteers who worked more than 10 slots will receive a free Stuyvesant Environmental Club water bottle!</b> So sign up quickly!
