Hi, if you're here, that means that you must have a reason to be looking at this?
Or maybe you just got lucky in finding this page.

First off, my name is Danny Qiu and I'm applying to be the Key Club webmaster for the 2013-2014 school year.

My goals as a webmaster are to create a usable site for key club that contains the viable resources needed to keep in touch with our members, and to create a site that perspective members can see to get a feel of what it means to be in key club.

Being a cab member, I will try my best to promote key club around the school in order to increase the size of our club. In addition, I will seek to make key club better and "combat the forces that tend to undermine our institutions"!

I guess I was only supposed to create a sample website, whoops.
