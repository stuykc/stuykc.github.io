  <h3><a href="TeacherVolunteerHoursForm.pdf" style="font-size:110%">&raquo; Teacher Volunteer Hours</a></h3>
  <p>Several of you have reached out to us about the possibility of receiving volunteer hours with Key Club for volunteer work you've been doing with teachers in the school. We would be more than happy to accept that work as an event with Key Club.Below is a form you will have to fill out and email back to us (stuyvesantkeyclub@gmail.com) so that we can record the work you do appropriately. The deadline to send us your form is May 19th.
  </p>

  <p>If you volunteer in the library during your frees, you may also receive hours!</p>

  <p><b>You may consider 1 period = 1 hour when filling out the <a href="TeacherVolunteerHoursForm.pdf">form.</b></a></p>

  <h3><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/IQGxnPZ9dn" style="font-size:110%">&raquo; Library Tutoring</a></h3>
  <p>Every Saturday, Stuy students from the different boroughs  travel to a local New York Public Library branch, where they volunteer to tutor children in grades K-8. Just go to the location, find a group of Stuyvesant-looking students (there will probably be posters/signs), and tell them you're from Stuyvesant Key Club. If you sign up to be project captain, send us a PRF once a month with the cumulative hours! You will not need to submit a PRF every week!
  </p>

  <p><b>Sign up for all library branches <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q3R1b-TCx6Q9sg3tBFdut8pSF603CWqI_1Y4dd66A0E/viewform?edit_requested=true">here</a></b></p>

  <p>Note: Working Papers are required to volunteer at any Queens Library Branch</p>
