  <h3><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/IQGxnPZ9dn" style="font-size:110%">&raquo; Library Tutoring</a></h3>
  <p>Every Saturday, Stuy students from the different boroughs  travel to a local New York Public Library branch, where they volunteer to tutor children in grades K-8. Just go to the location, find a group of Stuyvesant-looking students (there will probably be posters/signs), and tell them you're from Stuyvesant Key Club. If you sign up to be project captain, send us a PRF once a month with the cumulative hours! You will not need to submit a PRF every week!
  </p>

  <p><b>Sign up for all library branches <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q3R1b-TCx6Q9sg3tBFdut8pSF603CWqI_1Y4dd66A0E/viewform?edit_requested=true">here</a></b></p>
