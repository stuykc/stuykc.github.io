        bio: Hi StuyKC! I'm Wendy Huang, vice president of the 2013-2014 service year. After discovering Key Club since freshmen year, I have truly fell for everything that Key Club represents. From making new friends to volunteering at various events, Key Club has played a major role within my social life, contrary to popular belief that Stuy students don't have social lives. Outside of school and Key Club, I enjoy swimming, playing badminton, dancing, and shopping.

        bio: My name is Dorothy Chen, and I'm a junior at Stuyvesant High School. I am glad to be your Bulletin Editor this service year. Since joining Key Club, community service has become an indispensable part in my life. Besides, I enjoy watching movies. I realized my love for fiction when I watched Lord of the Rings and Star Wars over and over again. Now I started to watch some literary film and tried to understand them. Key Club is a family, giving me friendship, spirit and enthusiasm. I hope you can find the same things and even more here! You can contact me at <a href="mailto:dorothychen.editor@stuykc.org">dorothychen.editor@stuykc.org</a>.
