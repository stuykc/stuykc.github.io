        bio: My name is Dorothy Chen and I am glad to be your Secretary this service year. Since joining Key Club, community service has become an indispensable part in my life. Besides, I enjoy watching movies. I realized my love for fiction when I watched Lord of the Rings and Star Wars over and over again. Now I started to watch some literary film and tried to understand them. Key Club is a family, giving me friendship, spirit and enthusiasm. I hope you can find the same things and even more here!
