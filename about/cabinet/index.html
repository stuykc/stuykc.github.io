      <p>Hey Key Clubbers!

The new service year is now in full swing and our first month was already filled with lots of fundraising and service. Thank you to everyone who attended a service project (or many) in April or supported any of our fundraising efforts in April, whether it's buying a book at Barnes and Noble, coming to see Avengers: Endgame, buying a donut at March of Dimes, or grabbing a bite at Chipotle to close off the month. Our first month was already so amazing, I can't wait to see what's in store for the rest of the service year!

With the start of a new service year means a new cycle of committees! The entire cabinet spent the beginning of April conducting committee director interviews. Congratulations once again to all the new directors, who you will hear from in this issue and kudos to everyone who applied because you guys were all so great and the decisions were not easy. Committee signups were released and are now closed. Some directors had already sent out their first assignment while others are planning to conduct interviews for committee applicants! I'm so excited about all the things that will be achieved this committee cycle!

May is full of more awesome events, like Japan Day and Passport to Taiwan just to name a few. We also have some fundraisers planned for y'all so watch out for those, such as the current Yuda Bands fundraiser that you should definitely check out! I look forward to another month of outstanding service projects and fundraisers! "May" the next month be even better than this one.

Yours in caring service,
Jason üêº</p>

      <p>Hey everyone!

April has gone by quickly and in comes May! I hope everyone enjoyed Endgame because I personally still haven't watched it :') If you haven't taken your APs yet, good luck! For those of you who took them already, good job! I'm sure you all will do amazing! APs aside, I hope that the events we've had were enjoyable and fun for everyone! If you have any comments on what's currently going on in Key Club, I really would appreciate it if you reached out to any of the cab members to give us any suggestions and improvements! I'd like to meet anyone that I haven't met yet either, so message me for anything! I'd love to just talk about random events! Here's to another fun month!

      <h2>TREASURER: Vincent Huang </h2>
      <p>Hey Key Clubbers!

        Hey Key Clubbers! üíïüíï

        It's your treasurer Vincent here with your April update! April has been an extremely busy month for fundraisers but I'm proud to say that we're starting off the service year in such a strong way. For our Barnes & Noble Fundraiser early on in April, a portion of all purchases made with a voucher (including those at a caf√©) went to the Thirst Project! It was amazing to see so many familiar faces participating in the cause and helping to support Key Club! It was definitely a success because of you guys :) For our Endgame Fundraiser hosted alongside Bronx Science Key Club, we had a turnout of 319 people and made $1,534 to go to the Thirst Project. The movie was so good and it honestly amazes me how we were able to raise that much- thank you so much to everyone who came and we hope you had a great time! At our annual March for Babies, StuyKC sold Krispy Kreme Donuts and though we had a crazy amount to sell in 300 donuts, we managed to sell them all and make $312. All proceeds are going to the March of Dimes, which will help to fund research in order to prevent premature births and birth defects, while also supporting mothers who are unable to support maternal care. As I'm writing this right now, the Chipotle Fundraiser has yet to happen but I'm sure that it'll definitely do awesome too! Though our fundraising goal might seem like daunting, we're doing so well for just the first month and I can't thank you guys enough for that. I can't wait to continue the hard work and effort with my fundraising directors- Alan Guo and Evelyn Cao- and also the Fundraising Committee (which you should definitely consider joining for the new service year, along with the other committees) for our future fundraisers. For May, we have a lot planned in store, including the sale of Yuda Bands ;) ;) and a special bake sale coming later on in the month!

        I love you guys 3,000! Let's keep this service year going strong :)</p>

    <p>Hi everyone!

Hope you‚Äôre having a happy May. It was super rainy today, so I hope you stayed dried and warm. (I didn‚Äôt *~*). Some committees have already released their acceptances, and some haven‚Äôt yet, so look out for that. I‚Äôm really happy if you guys chose to join. Speaking of committees, our new directors of the 2019-2020 service year has been released. Big clap clap!

We have so many wonderful events the month of May, so make sure to sign up and attend! May 18th currently has more than 3 events, so volunteers are welcomed. Aids walk is on the 19th, and it‚Äôs divisional! Come to meet other people from the division. In addition, tomorrow is the May divisional held at Baruch. We will be going as a group, so make sure to come if you can! There will be cards, board games and more.

I hope that all of you enjoyed our first May meeting held on Friday. Thank you for coming if you did. Another meeting will be held soon. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure many people have already said this but, buy the apparel!! It‚Äôs super cute, and the more people that buy it, the cheaper it gets. As always, if you have any questions, comments, concerns, don‚Äôt hesitate to shoot me a text.

Caring: Our way of life</p>

    <p>Hi Key Clubbers!


As some of you guys may have noticed, I‚Äôve been sending out confirmation emails this month and will continue to do so for May. Your cab has decided to divide the confirmation emails throughout the service year among ourselves. In June your new editor, Rachel Joh will be sending them.


I will be updating events and fundraisers for May very soon. During this service year I will look to update everything I need to and gradually add changes to the website as things carry on.


My plans for the next coming months is to revamp our entire website to have a more modern and convenient design as well as update the website as much as possible. Also, look forward to our LTC video coming soon! Yours in service, Jackson Ngo</p>

    <h2>EDITOR: <span>Rachel Joh</span></h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sammi, and I'll be your editor for the 2018-2019 service year! Outside of Key Club, you can normally find me at basically every environmental-related club. I love drinking taro bubble tea, watching cringey Disney shows on Netflix, and admiring expensive stationery. I also have a passion for creating, whether it‚Äôs writing, helping others improve their writing, or publishing The Locksmith every month, which is why I am really looking forward to working with our new Locksmith Director, Rachel, and the entire committee this year! But most of all, I‚Äôm looking forward to find more ways to better integrate the club as a whole into The Locksmith. Let me clarify - it‚Äôs always been one of the fundamental goals for The Locksmith to be a visual representation and method of communicating with the members, while also being a place for members to reflect on the service we‚Äôve done each month. I also want to improve communication with the committee overall in order to make the team as efficient as possible, as well as working on connecting with other Key Clubs across the city!</p>
