        bio: I’m Michelle, the new President of Stuyvesant Key Club. This year, I plan to make the Key Club in our school bigger and more dedicated than before. One of the points in my speech during the election was to make our club more connected with the other clubs in Division 11 so that is something that I will also work on with the rest of the cabinet. I want Key Club and the people in Key Club to be an inspiration for all the members and a source of encouragement. What I don’t want, is there to be a barrier between the members and the cab because we are a very close-knit and inclusive club. If you guys have any questions or you just want to message me for whatever reason, feel free! I’m always open to talk.

        bio: Hi Key Clubbers! My name is Yuki Lau and I am your vice president for the new service year. I first joined Key Club freshman year and it's been an integral part of Stuy for me. I have made so many friends and new relationships through this amazing club. I also really really love food and soccer (barca!), so don't be surprised if we're talking and I suddenly say, 'do you wanna go to _______ to eat?' Don't be afraid to talk to me! I'm a really friendly person so hmu if you have any questions. Hope to meet you all at events!

        bio: Hi Key Clubbers! My name is Tiffany Chen, and I’m your new Editor for the 2017-2018 service year. I am super excited! As Editor, I plan to reinvent the Locksmith to make it more representative if Key Club International. Along with including updates from the Cab every issue to let you know what’s going on, I will announce anything that is going on with Key Clubs from around the world. In addition, every Locksmith, I will have a spread of a different school in NYC to let you know how other Key Clubs close to us work. I will try to increase the publishing of the Locksmith from bimonthly to monthly by emphasizing these announcements more in later Locksmiths. However, photos and articles submissions from you all are still a vital part of the newsletter. I plan to increase submissions by emailing the Key Clubbers who attended the event to submit things to the Locksmith. Last, I plan to make the Locksmith more beautiful with new layouts such as this one. I hope you all continue to read the Locksmith. Feel free to hit me up whenever and talk to me about anything! :D

        bio: Hello Key Club! I am Jason Lam and I’m super excited to be your new Webmaster for the 2017-2018 service year! As your Webmaster, I will do my best to make your online experience with the club website as great as possible. As Webmaster, I will be implementing new features as well as new visuals to really display Stuyvesant Key Club in the best way possible. Of course, maintaining professionalism is my number one priority, so incremental updates would be the best for both the club and the website. I really hope that the website exceeds your expectations and inspires you to be more active in Key Club. Outside of Key Club, I like to play games and hangout with friends and family. I currently play popular PC games League of Legends and Overwatch as well as Super Smash Brothers. Feel free to talk with me about games or if you just simply need a person to talk to!

        bio: Hey guys! I’m Jenna and I’m your secretary for the 2017 – 2018 school year!! We joke and say that here in Key Club, we don’t make keys, but it’s obvious to me that Key Club has given me some keys of my own. I have been able to take on a leadership role, something that has given me a newfound independence and an outlet through which I can help others. I have also forged a stronger connection with our own school’s Key Club, and I’ve gotten to know our members on a personal level. As secretary for the 2017-2018 service year, I plan to devote my full attention and hard work to completing the tasks that keep Key Club running smoothly (updating the points sheet, informing you guys of new events, etc.). Key Club is such a tight-knit community of amazing people and getting more members to discover this hidden gem will always be a goal of mine.

        bio: Hey Key Clubbers! I’m Justin and I’ll be your Treasurer for the upcoming service year! As your Treasurer, I plan on increasing incentives that official Key Club members receive. I also want to expand our club within Stuyvesant by increasing awareness of our events and how we’re much more than a service club. On a divisional level, I plan on expanding our fundraisers by getting other schools to come, which also promotes inter-clubbing. Even though I’m technically in charge of the financial aspect of Key Club, as Treasurer, I’ll do everything in my power to expand Stuyvesant Key Club.
