      <h2>PRESIDENT: <span>Jenna Foo</span></h2>
      <p>Hi! I‚Äôm Jenna a.k.a the next dictator of StuyKC! As dictator, my goal is to expose Key Club for what it is: the most genuine and close-knit family out there ‚ò∫Ô∏è I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs in store for us next year and I hope to drag along as many people as possible on this crazy journey üíï</p>

      <h2>VICE PRESIDENT: <span>Penny Wang</span></h2>
      <p>Hey guys! I'm Penny and I am your vice president for the 2018-2019 service year. I joined Key Club the summer before Freshman year thinking that it was just a regular service club. However, I couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. I found Key Club to be an amazing community of friends, even a big family. As all of us attended volunteer events and plan/ attended fundraisers, I saw how hard working and dedicated Key Clubbers were. As vice president, I want to encourage better communication between the six committees of our club as well as with board members. I want to encourage all committee members to play an active role in keeping Key Club running, from advertising, to helping plan fundraisers. I also want to be a good leader, helping my board members run Key Club and trying to bring together my fellow Key Clubbers. I'm more than glad to help out and talk to you guys at events!</p>

      <h2>TREASURER: Freya Zhu</h2>
      <p>Hey guys!!! For those of you don't know, I'm Freya Zhu and I will be your treasurer for the 2018-2019 service year! The experiences and memories that I have made during the time I'm in Key Club are ones that I will remember for the rest of my life. I want Key Club to have a huge positive impact on the lives of others just like it did on mine. For this new service year, the fundraising goal will be $10,000. Yes, it is a big number to wrap your head around but I know if I have all of you dedicated and passionate members to help me, we will reach that goal in no time! I want fundraisers to be more fun. To connect more people. That is why I will reach out to Kiwanis Builders Club and potentially hold some fundraisers together. This way, not only will we increase our donations to charity, we will foster the new generation of Key Clubbers! Key Club holds a strong power especially if the right people are chosen to guide it. This is why I have all of you guys!</p>

    <h2>WEBMASTER:<span>Tiffany Zhong</span></h2>
    <p>Hey Key Clubbers! I'm Tiffany Zhong and I'm thrilled to be your webmaster for the 2018-2019 service year! On my free time I like to take photos, and occasionally run. I love how Key Club brings together the community of high schoolers who are willing to dedicate their time to bettering the community. It's amazing and moving to see how dedicated our members are, especially the freshmen (notably the ones who wake up in four or five in the morning to go to an event). As your webmaster, I want to make your online experience as convenient as possible through frequently updating and developing the website. Hopefully, the website will make your experience in Key Club even more enjoyable than it already is. Hit me up if you have any questions üôÇ !</p>

    <h2>SECRETARY:<span> Jason Xiong</span></h2>
    <p>I would like to begin with a bunny pun but instead, we should just hop right in. Hey guys, it's Jason Xiong, your club secretary for the 2018-2019 service year. To many people, Key Club is just another volunteer organization that you join to get hours. However, every event I attend and all the time I spent with other Key Clubbers prove it wrong. Through Key Club, I'm given many opportunities to have unique experiences and meet some of the most amazing people who I proudly call my second family. As secretary, I hope to make your Key Club experience as smooth as possible. I'll be working closely with the New Projects committee, aka the best committee, with my fantastic directors Jackson and Weini. Together, we will find events that will help you make long-lasting memories. Beside events, I will do my best to send out events and announcements emails (with terrible puns) with the rest of the cabinet to keep y'all in the loop. Of course, I will ensure everyone gets the hours they worked hard for and together, we can make the 2018-2019 service year awesome.</p>

    <h2>EDITOR: <span>Sammi Lin</span></h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sammi, and I'll be your editor for the 2018-2019 service year! Outside of Key Club, you can normally find me at basically every environmental-related club. I love drinking taro bubble tea, watching cringey Disney shows on Netflix, and admiring expensive stationery. I also have a passion for creating, whether it‚Äôs writing, helping others improve their writing, or publishing The Locksmith every month, which is why I am really looking forward to working with our new Locksmith Director, Rachel, and the entire committee this year! But most of all, I‚Äôm looking forward to find more ways to better integrate the club as a whole into The Locksmith. Let me clarify - it‚Äôs always been one of the fundamental goals for The Locksmith to be a visual representation and method of communicating with the members, while also being a place for members to reflect on the service we‚Äôve done each month. I also want to improve communication with the committee overall in order to make the team as efficient as possible, as well as working on connecting with other Key Clubs across the city!</p>
