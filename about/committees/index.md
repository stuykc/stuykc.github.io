## Art <small> Penny Wang & Lucy Wu </small>

<blockquote>Hey guys, I'm back!
Now that I'm the art director, I can't wait to do so many things this service year with my codirector. I'm determined to hold many workshops hosted by the art committee and make the scrapbook/ update the bulletin board. There's so many fun things in store and I believe art will be a tight knit group. All of you guys should apply for Art, even if you're not that artsy, and I believe we will make Key Club colorful together <3.

~ Heyy, my name is Lucy Wu for those of you that don’t know me. Key Club means the world to me, and I’ve enjoyed meeting so many people through it. Art is also my favorite hobby, so I’m thrilled to be working with Penny as one of your art directors for the 2019-2020 service year. As art director, I wish to get members of the art committee to be more involved by holding several workshops for things like scrapbooking or changing the theme of the bulletin board. I also want to work on time management to make sure we complete all assignments on time, especially the scrapbook. Let’s work on getting first place! I’ll do my best to make sure this service year is fun and memorable. :))

## Fundraising <small> Alan Guo & Vincent Huang</small>

<blockquote>Hi everyone reading! I’m Alan Guo, and co-director with Vincent Huang of your favorite Fundraising Committee! We are responsible for creating, planning, and hosting fundraisers throughout the year (which is much more complex than it seems). More specifically, we work as a team along with our treasurer to discuss prices and maximize revenue, communicate with companies professionally to plan, report back to the committee, delegate tasks, and in general, manage our funds and host fundraisers to run smoothly. These events connect us with our members, Stuyvesant, and community, which brings Key Club closer to all of you!
The Locksmith is a monthly official publication featuring the firing passion of the Stuyvesant Key Club and the memories of each event. All articles and photographs come from members themselves and our job is to combine these voices into a fabulous newsletter that summarizes the blood, sweat, and tears contributed into each and every event. In just a few pages, we express our experiences and impressions of helping out local communities, hoping to inspire others to join the cause.</blockquote>

## New Projects <small> Jackson Ngo & Weini Zhou </small>

<blockquote> New Projects is a committee that makes sure people can volunteer every week. We find events and communicate with organizations so key club can keep running. As directors, we hope to find better events and also get feedback on previous ones. Our goal is to find events that people with busy schedules or those who live in far away places can reach.</blockquote>

## Public Relations <small> Sonia Lee & Winnie Huang </small>

<blockquote>Hey everyone! I'm Winnie and I'm one of your PR coheads for the 2018-2019 service year. Along with Sonia and our PR committee, we are planning on advertising for fundraisers and just the overall beauty of Key Club to the fullest. What we do is handle the public image of Stuyvesant Key Club and uphold its reputation inside the Stuyvesant community and outside. Further, to promote our slogan, "Caring - Our Way of Life" which encapsulates the core values of Key Club, will seek for innovative ways to reach out and recruit new members such as through usage of eye-catching posters, video updates, and social media. Finally, the last aspect of our mission is to assist in spreading the word regarding upcoming fundraisers. Along with the other committees, we hope to work together to help Key Club grow and prosper. With that, Sonia and I are looking forward to meeting everyone and helping to make this one of the best service years!</blockquote>

## Web/Video <small> Irene Chen </small>

<blockquote>The web/video committee works to capture key club at its finest- at fundraisers, events, and more. We use videos taken by committee and club members, and we edit them and cut them together to create bimonthly recaps that showcase what our club has been doing. We also work closely with our webmaster to add to and improve our club's site.</blockquote>
