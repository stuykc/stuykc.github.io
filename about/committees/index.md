### Locksmith (Willie Xu):

### New Projects (Olivia Zhong):

<blockquote>The New Projects Committee help find new events to go to or come up with ideas for an event in school or for members of the club to participate in. This does not have to be just events for us to volunteer at, but also an activity among club members where we charge a small amount which will be donated to a cause. For example, a few years ago we had a photo hunt around Stuy and recently, we had a Karoake event where we raised money for the <a href="http://www.keyclub.org/service/TheEliminateProject.aspx">Eliminate Project</a>.</blockquote>

### Public Relations (Eric Kim, Sunny Zhang, Josh Chan):

They are also responsible for posting up memberâ€™s points on the website, posting up pictures of events, as well as compiling a list of our recent and upcoming events.</blockquote>
