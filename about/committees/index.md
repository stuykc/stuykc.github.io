### Advocacy (Briana Lui and Alvin Wei):

<blockquote>Pick and issue that you'd like to improve in the community and work to make some kind of change.</blockquote>

### Art (Eliza Hripcsak and Casey Ching):

<blockquote>Help redecorate the bulletin every so often to make it look BEAUTIFUL! Also, help us work on the picture scrapbook that we enter at the New York District Leadership Training Conference each year.</blockquote>

### Fundraising (Brian Wei, Lynn Wang, and Jenny Lin):

<blockquote>Help come up with new fundraising ideas and work together to actually get them going. The one we're currently working on is making polymer clay figures and selling them!</blockquote>

### Locksmith (Willie Xu):

<blockquote>Work on the club newsletter with the club editor either by writing for it or just working on putting it together. We'd like to start having monthly or bimonthly issues of it.</blockquote>

### New Projects (Olivia Zhong):

<blockquote>Help find new events to go to or come up with ideas for an event in school or for members of the club to participate in. This does not have to be just events for us to volunteer at but also an activity among club members where we charge a small amount which will be donated to a cause. For example, a few years ago we had a photo hunt around Stuy.</blockquote>

### Public Relations (Eric Kim, Sunny Zhang, Josh Chan):

<blockquote>Help spread the word about Key Club, both inside the school and out. This might also involve making posters for meetings/events that we want to tell people about.</blockquote>

### Web/Video (Alicia Devalencia):

<blockquote>Help work on the website along with the webmaster by either providing ideas for what can be added to it or changed or by directing working on the site yourself.</blockquote>
