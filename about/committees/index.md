## Art <small>🎨 Penny Wang & Lucy Wu 🎨</small>

<blockquote>Hey guys, I'm back!
Now that I'm the art director, I can't wait to do so many things this service year with my codirector. I'm determined to hold many workshops hosted by the art committee and make the scrapbook/ update the bulletin board. There's so many fun things in store and I believe art will be a tight knit group. All of you guys should apply for Art, even if you're not that artsy, and I believe we will make Key Club colorful together <3.

 💕💕 Heyy, my name is Lucy Wu for those of you that don’t know me. Key Club means the world to me, and I’ve enjoyed meeting so many people through it. Art is also my favorite hobby, so I’m thrilled to be working with Penny as one of your art directors for the 2019-2020 service year. As art director, I wish to get members of the art committee to be more involved by holding several workshops for things like scrapbooking or changing the theme of the bulletin board. I also want to work on time management to make sure we complete all assignments on time, especially the scrapbook. Let’s work on getting first place! I’ll do my best to make sure this service year is fun and memorable. :))

## Fundraising <small> 💰 Alan Guo & Evelyn Cao 💰</small>

<blockquote>Hello everyone my name is Evelyn and I'll your fundraising director for 2019-2020 service year! As fundraising director, my job will be to organize fundraisers along with my other director, Alan Guo, and my lovely treasurer, Vincent Huang. Vincent, Alan, and I have so many new ideas in mind for this service year. We plan on hosting several fundraisers at venues around Stuyvesant  at places we have never held a fundraiser at before and even host a fundraiser inside Stuyvesant (not the traditional selling things at a table kind). We are also branching out from our traditional fundraisers and adding new and exciting elements to them for fresh experiences for our attendees (Wink Wink). Throughout the service year, we will have committee members be more involved in the logistical details behind planning fundraisers in preparation for our big finale fundraiser: a member organized fundraiser where the members plan out everything! Cheers to a new service year and (hopefully) lots of MONEY MADE!!!!!💕💕 Hey hey HEY! Your [favorite] fundraising director is bacccckkkkk for another rich service year. If you don’t know me yet, my name’s Alan and I’m just a tall guy from a small town, but with BIG dreams, especially for Key Club! This time around, I'm joined with my co-head Evelyn Cao, and Treasurer Vincent Huang! For this year, we’re planning even bigger things: AT LEAST one fundraiser held monthly and bringing them even closer to Stuyvesant High School. We plan to reach out to our close community and let our student peers get the most fun out donating to charity at the same time. With our wonderful fundraising committee, we plan to make a closer-knit team with much more involvement in behind the scenes work like planning, and greater independence when hosting. With this, we hope by the end of the year to have our members plan and host their own fundraiser with minimal help! The year may seem daunting, but I know StuyKC can destroy our expectations and raise even more money for amazing causes.

<blockquote>Hi everyone!

I’m Keyi Guo, your Locksmith committee director! I am currently a sophomore and have been part of the committee since freshman year.

I hope that everyone submits pictures and articles. We need your effort to help publish monthly. We would like to share your memories of events and the fun you have. I am looking forward to working with everyone and I’m open to suggestions too. Please read the Locksmith :)

## New Projects <small> 📅 Elizabeth Doss & Zixuan Liu 📅</small>

<blockquote> Hello, here's my paragraph for New Projects.

Hi guys!! My name is Elizabeth Doss and I’m super excited to be one of your New Projects committee directors! I am currently a junior and hope to find tons of awesome events for everyone to volunteer at this year. As a director I will try to find events that all Key Clubbers will enjoy and surpass our past number of completed service hours with events that are more convenient for members. I am looking forward to working with the other directors, the Cab, and committee members to make this year amazing!💕💕Hello Key Club!
This is your new New Projects director, Zi. First, I want to say that Key Club has been an important part of my high school experience, and it is the biggest family I have at Stuy. Through Key Club, I joined New Projects, which always attracted me, since I’m not the most outgoing person, and finding events was a very interesting experience. I want to also thank the previous directors and secretary, since they did so much for the committee last year. As director, I will try my best to help Key Club achieve our goals for the 2019-20 service year, especially making sure that we hit our goal of 9,000 hours. Along with Elizabeth, we are ready to make sure that New Projects will be an efficient committee, and we will implement minor changes this year so that our Key Clubbers can be more updated about events. Events are very important, and they are essential when it comes to bonding with fellow members and exploring the world, so I will ensure that they will be pleasant experiences. I am very excited to work with our Cab members and fellow directors to make sure that the year runs smoothly!

## Social Media <small>📹 Constance Chen & Irene Chen 📹 </small>

<blockquote>Hey everyone!

I doubt anyone is going to actually read this but I am so excited to serve as your Social Media Director for the 2019-2020 service year!

I cannot be more grateful for the day I decided to be lazy and join Key Club instead of Red Cross (we had a shorter form ahah) since I cannot even begin to imagine what it would be like without Key Club. It allowed me to be part of a community that works together towards for a greater purpose.

As Social Media director, I hope to work together with my co-director, Irene, to celebrate our achievements as a club through our Instagram and recap videos. On Instagram, not only do we want to be more active in highlighting events and fundraisers, but also to bring a spotlight to new members and members of the month. We also want to create appealing posters and videos to promote fundraisers and produce recap videos for our YouTube channel.

Hopefully, we can work together as family to make a positive and lasting impact on our club! 💕💕 Hey guys!
I’m Irene and I’m one of the social media directors for the new service year! I’m super hyped to be working with you all and I hope to improve on my work from last year when I was the Web/Video committee director. I will work hard to keep our social media up and running, create more videos, and help promote our events and fundraisers. Make sure to keep up with Social Media Committee’s posters, recaps, and posts! I look forward to meeting, bonding, and having fun with our new committee members! Join our committee to make your key club experience the best haha 😁❤️
