## Art <small> Tina Chen & Kelly Guo </small>

<blockquote>The Stuyvesant Key club art committee is in charge of making posters for the various fundraisers we have, update the Key Club bulletin board near the second floor entrance, and to make our yearly scrapbook (Hawaiian Theme). What we hope to accomplish in the committee is to try to get more people to come to fundraisers and get more people involved. We plan to keep key club's reputation as fun and exciting as possible with art.</blockquote>

## Fundraising <small> Alan Guo & Vincent Huang</small>

<blockquote>Hi everyone reading! Iâ€™m Alan Guo, and co-director with Vincent Huang of your favorite Fundraising Committee! We are responsible for creating, planning, and hosting fundraisers throughout the year (which is much more complex than it seems). More specifically, we work as a team along with our treasurer to discuss prices and maximize revenue, communicate with companies professionally to plan, report back to the committee, delegate tasks, and in general, manage our funds and host fundraisers to run smoothly. These events connect us with our members, Stuyvesant, and community, which brings Key Club closer to all of you!
The Locksmith is a monthly official publication featuring the firing passion of the Stuyvesant Key Club and the memories of each event. All articles and photographs come from members themselves and our job is to combine these voices into a fabulous newsletter that summarizes the blood, sweat, and tears contributed into each and every event. In just a few pages, we express our experiences and impressions of helping out local communities, hoping to inspire others to join the cause.</blockquote>

## New Projects <small> Jackson Ngo & Weini Zhou </small>

<blockquote> New Projects is a committee that makes sure people can volunteer every week. We find events and communicate with organizations so key club can keep running. As directors, we hope to find better events and also get feedback on previous ones. Our goal is to find events that people with busy schedules or those who live in far away places can reach.</blockquote>

## Public Relations <small> Sonia Lee & Winnie Huang </small>

<blockquote>Hey everyone! I'm Winnie and I'm one of your PR coheads for the 2018-2019 service year. Along with Sonia and our PR committee, we are planning on advertising for fundraisers and just the overall beauty of Key Club to the fullest. What we do is handle the public image of Stuyvesant Key Club and uphold its reputation inside the Stuyvesant community and outside. Further, to promote our slogan, "Caring - Our Way of Life" which encapsulates the core values of Key Club, will seek for innovative ways to reach out and recruit new members such as through usage of eye-catching posters, video updates, and social media. Finally, the last aspect of our mission is to assist in spreading the word regarding upcoming fundraisers. Along with the other committees, we hope to work together to help Key Club grow and prosper. With that, Sonia and I are looking forward to meeting everyone and helping to make this one of the best service years!</blockquote>

## Web/Video <small> Irene Chen </small>

<blockquote>The web/video committee works to capture key club at its finest- at fundraisers, events, and more. We use videos taken by committee and club members, and we edit them and cut them together to create bimonthly recaps that showcase what our club has been doing. We also work closely with our webmaster to add to and improve our club's site.</blockquote>
