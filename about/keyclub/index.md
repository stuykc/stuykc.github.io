title: About Key Club International
---
*I pledge, on my honor, to uphold the Objects of Key Club International; to build my home, school and community; to serve my nation and God; and combat all forces which tend to undermine these institutions.*

**Key Club International**, a service leadership program of Kiwanis International, is the oldest and largest service organization for high school students, and gives its members opportunities to provide service, build character and develop leadership skills.  
Started in California in 1925, Key Club today thrives in more than 5,000 high school campuses with a total membership of 265,000 in 32 countries, including North America, the Caribbean nations, Central and South America, and most recently, Asia and Australia.

Key Club attributes its success to the fact that it is a student-led organization that teaches leadership through serving others. In other words, as members of the Kiwanis International family, Key Club members build themselves as they build their schools and communities.

Among the opportunities provided to members are:

- Leadership development
- Vocational guidance
- College scholarships
- Subscription to KEY CLUB magazine
- Service-learning
- Personal enrichment
- Value-added member benefit programs
- Liability insurance coverage

Originally, Key Club adopted as its motto, "We Build," the same motto as its parent organization, Kiwanis International. In 1976, the program changed its motto to, "Caring—Our Way of Life," to more clearly convey members’ reasons for helping others. Dues paid by every member fund Key Club, and its officers are high school leaders elected by the members at district and International conventions.
