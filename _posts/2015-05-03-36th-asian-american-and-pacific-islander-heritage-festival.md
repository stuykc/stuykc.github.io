Come and help out Chinatown BID and CAPA (Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans) with their annual Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Festival! During this event, we will be helping mostly with setup (moving supplies over, hanging up banners, arranging tables/chair, putting up tents, putting together a stage, carrying over crops, etc), manning the different fun activities, and cleanup.
