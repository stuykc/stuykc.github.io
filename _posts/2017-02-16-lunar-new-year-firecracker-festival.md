Better Chinatown is hosting the Lunar New Year Parade Festival for another year! Come celebrate the year of Rooster and bring joy to the Chinese American community on February 16th! We will be helping with set-up, break down, and helping the different companies run their booth. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time during the event itself to enjoy the festival! Lunch will be provided.
