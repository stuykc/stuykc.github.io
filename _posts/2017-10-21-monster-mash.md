We'll be helping out at Monster Mash, hosted by NYSoM! There will be Halloween activities such as pumpkin painting and slime making. Volunteers will be helping out at booths which will include a scavenger hunt, Halloween crafts, and other Halloween games and activities! And in the meantime, you can witness a costume contest and cool DJ-ing.
