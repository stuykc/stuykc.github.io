The 2015 Spring Amazing Race Fundraiser is coming up! For those who haven't been involved in this race before, the Amazing Race Fundraiser is an annual event where participants pay a small registration fee to take on challenges in a specific NYC area. All profits will be donated to charity! In order for the race to be possible we need volunteers to help us out! Please consider volunteering for the 2015 Amazing Race! 

**Volunteer duties will include, but are not limited to, managing stations and overseeing events, handing out clues when an event is complete, collecting registration fees and waivers in the morning, setting up and cleaning up at checkpoints, walking between checkpoints, organizing forms, preparing and transporting food, and crowd control.**
