The Carl Schurz Park Conservancy has an annual egg hunt for children on their massive lawn and they need our help! Volunteers will be helping to set up the event (placing eggs), oversee the event (passing out bunny ears), and break down the event. Did I mention that the Conservancy will be letting a volunteer dress up as the Easter Bunny? StuyKC will be volunteering with Bronx Science Key Club AND Millennium Key Club for this event!
