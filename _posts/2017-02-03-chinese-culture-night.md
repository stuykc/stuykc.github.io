The Chinese Culture Night is a great event for children and parents to create a link. The ticket is $30. Jeremy Lin is playing at Nets and he may be playing that night! Kiwanis Club can pay tickets for 25 Key Club members but and we/children must bring one or both of the parents. The parents have to pay their own tickets. Everyone may go but have to pay their own tickets. In addition, everyone will receive a Brooklyn Nets hat with Brooklyn Nets spelled out in Chinese. Sign up if you're interested!
