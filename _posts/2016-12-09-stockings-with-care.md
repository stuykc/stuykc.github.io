We'll be helping Stockings with Care at their Santa's Workshop! You will either help with gift wrapping or transport the gifts to the  workshop location. Stockings with Care aims to help New York City families in homeless shelters and assistance programs create the magic of Christmas morning for their kids. You need to be 16 in order to do this event. Make sure to bring an ID with you for this event!
