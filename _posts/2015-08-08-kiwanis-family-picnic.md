Hey all SLP members and Kiwanians, guess what? It's already been five years since the first Kiwanis Family Picnic was held, and  the 5TH ANNUAL KIWANIS FAMILY PICNIC WILL BE HELD THIS YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Last year, there were over 60 attendees at the picnic from 7 Circle K clubs, 10 Key Clubs, and 1 Kiwanis Club and we raised a total of $374 for the Eliminate Project (that's 207 babies saved!!!!!). This year's picnic will be happening right after the Queens K-Family Day of Service in Fresh Meadows, and we highly encourage picnic attendees to also attend the service event!!!!!

**Admission will consist of $5 each for us Key Clubbers, as well as $10 for Kiwanians and adults. Food will be included, and all members of the K-Family are invited to attend!**
