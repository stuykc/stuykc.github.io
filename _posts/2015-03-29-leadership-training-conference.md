We will be joining the rest of New York District Key Clubbers in an annual conference in Albany filled with different events, dances, workshops etc. Awards such as the Distinguished Key Clubber will be distributed during this Conference. But most importantly, this is an amazing chance to meet other Key Clubbers and connect with them over a couple of days.  This year's conference theme will be espionage.

LTC is a chance to get a full Key Club experience and get a glimpse at how big Key Club really is. We will be staying in the Desmond Hotel in Albany (We will be going to the hotel via coach bus, so don't worry about having to drive to Albany) from March 27-29 along with hundreds of Key Clubbers from all over New York! THIS IS THE BIGGEST, FUNNEST, BESTEST EVENT OF THE YEAR! Activities at LTC include

- Awards Ceremony (Where we will be recognized for our effotrs as a club from this year's service)
- Play fair (Basically huge icebreakers with hundreds of people)
- Workshops
- A Dance 
- Endless fun! (Seriously, negative reviews are non-existent)
And much, much more

**PSA: If you are elected as a cabinet member, you are required to go to LTC.**

As of now, we do not have a final price available for people who will be attending as we are working hard to get funding for you guys so you will have to pay the least. We are expecting the cost to be somewhere around $150-210. We know that this is a lot of money for most of you guys but we will continue to get other sources of money as the official pricing is $280 per person. There will be a cap at 18 people, so sign up quickly!

Also, we are in dire need of a chaperone, so please let us know if any of your parents are able to.
