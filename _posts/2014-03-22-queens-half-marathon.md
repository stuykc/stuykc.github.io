Volunteer for the Michelob ULTRA New York 13.1 MarathonÂ® and USRS 5K! (There are two races in this event) This third in a series of eight half marathon races staged from January through November in some of the country's biggest cities -- including Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami Beach, Boston and Fort Lauderdale -- the 13.1 Marathon New York made its debut in the spring of 2009, on a course that takes runners and walkers around some of the Queens borough's most notable tourist sites and attractions.

There will be about 5,000 walkers and runners. The race will serve as a fundraiser for Team World Vision, a non-profit organization that seeks to improve the lives of children and communities in Africa.
