Stuy hosts an annual College Night where representatives from colleges and universities all over the country come and speak about their school in addition to giving out pamphlets and other sorts of information. Volunteers will be helping out with the various stations and with any other duties that arise. Although the event ends quite late (8:30PM) we will also be offering EXTRA hours for helping out. Since JUNIORS should be attending the fair to learn more about the colleges, this event is ONLY OPEN TO FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORES, and SENIORS. We need as much help as we can get for this event, so it is UNCAPPED.
 
In addition, there is an orientation with Ms. Pedrick after 10th period in the cafeteria on Tuesday, April 29th for volunteers who will be attending. THIS IS OPTIONAL She will be going over the basic gist of what will be going on and what jobs the volunteers will be responsible for. Be sure to sign out with a Red Cross leader to receive additional hours for attending the meeting! It's very important for you to attend this beforehand but if you cannot, we understand, and a recap e-mail will be sent out.
