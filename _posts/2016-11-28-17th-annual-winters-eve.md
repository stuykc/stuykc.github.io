Winterâ€™s Eve at Lincoln Square is a celebration for the entire Lincoln Square neighborhood. It kicks off the holiday season with the Upper West Side's only tree lighting ceremony and keeps the excitement going all evening with dozens of free live performances, food tastings from top local restaurants, and tons of family fun. Winter's Eve is an outdoor event, so please dress warmly and wear comfortable clothing!
