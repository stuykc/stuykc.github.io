We will be helping out with the annual Color Run manning the color station (throwing color at people), registration, and handing out t-shirts.  The Color Run is 5k race where the runners get blasted by different colors of the rainbow.  PLEASE NOTE that in order to volunteer at the color station, you may have to arrive extra early since the position is usually taken up really fast.
