Volunteers will be helping beautify the park through planting daffodil bulbs, weeding, and raking leaves. Be sure to wear clothes that you won’t mind getting dirty. All materials, including rakes, gloves, and shovels will be provided! This is an interclub event and we’ll be working with Bronx Science Key Club!!
