We will be assisting Chinatown BID with cleaning the streets and planting trees and flowers around Kimlau Square! This is a very important event since we work closely with Chinatown BID on many major events such as the Weekend Walks and we want to continue that collaboration in the future! Key Clubbers from Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn will also be coming, so you can make friends from other schools if you want!

**This event is on the same day as the Walk for Kids Growth event.**
