The Epic Ride is a 40-mile bike route along the waterfrontâ€™s edge from Greenpoint to Rockaway Beach and supports Brooklyn Greenway Initiative. We'll be helping with set up and breakdown, checking in riders, serving snacks and beverages at rest stops, providing information, and other tasks.

**The time will now be from 6 AM - 9 AM at Newtown Barge Playground. There is another shift from 9 AM - 2 PM at the Finish Line at Rockaway Beach. If you're doing the first shift, transportation can be provided for you. You'll be driven to Rockaway Beach.**
