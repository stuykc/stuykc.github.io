To our new and prospective members, we will be hosting our annual interest meeting in the cafeteria after 10th period.  We know how stressful life at Stuyvesant is and we hope that we will be something that you will look forward to for the rest of your Stuy life.  At our interest meeting, you will be able to find out more about the nation's largest community service club.

To our old and returning members, we have something special waiting for you.  Come to the interest meeting to see it for yourself.
