The Divisional Training Conference (DTC) is like a mini version of our annual Leadership Training Conference in Albany. We'll have workshops and other fun events for you all to participate in, as well as lunch. Coming to DTC can help you with your leadership, planning, and professional skills, while getting to know Key Clubbers from other divisions around the city at the same time!
