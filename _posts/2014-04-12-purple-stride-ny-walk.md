Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, with a relative five-year survival rate of just 6%. It has the lowest relative five-year survival rate of any major cancer. Pancreatic cancer research has been underfunded and this walk will raise money to help change these dismal statistics by funding research grants, advocacy efforts, patient support, and awareness activities coordinated by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. We will be helping with registration, set up, clean up, kids play zone, race route volunteers, greeters and more. Bronx Science Key Club will also be there, so it'll be a great way to interclub as well.
