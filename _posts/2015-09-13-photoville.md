We'll be helping out at Photoville, which the largest annual photographic event in this city. They'll have many awesome photo exhibitions inside shipping containers. Volunteers will help man the entrances, exhibitions and booths, pass flyers out, etc. and will receive a Smorgasburg food voucher for every shift worked. Although there's still some time till the event, the coordinators would like to have more time to set a schedule, so save the date if you sign up!
