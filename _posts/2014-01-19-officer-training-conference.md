With elections coming up, we would like to give you a chance to learn more about the officer positions that you can run for. There will be workshops where the current board members explain their positions and what they do. It's quite worthwhile to know what your tasks will be before you assume the position. Also, we'll be having other workshops in case you're not thinking about running for certain positions. There is a lot to learn, so don't miss out!
