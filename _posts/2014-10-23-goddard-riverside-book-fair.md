For this Event, we will be helping out Goddard Riverside Community Center with their annual book fair. We will help sell the thousands of books that were donated to the Community Center. 

Mr Blumm is coordinating this event for all Stuyvesant Clubs. However, through Blumm, we will be filling up empty spots that other volunteers didn't sign up for. We are still waiting for the number of spots that needs to be filled. Normally, this would mean that this event will be capped, something that we normally won't do. HOWEVER, we have a loophole for you guys. You may register for this event directly through their website and avoid not being able to help out for this event [here](https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/WebLink.aspx?name=E165152&id=8).
