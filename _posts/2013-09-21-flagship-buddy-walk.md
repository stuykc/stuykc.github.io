We welcome you to help out at the 19th Annual Flagship Buddy Walk! This walk is to honor and celebrate the individuals with Down Syndrome in our communities. It raises awareness of this condition and funds programs that benefit people affected by the disease. We will be helping with the walk, along with setting up the events on the sidelines.
