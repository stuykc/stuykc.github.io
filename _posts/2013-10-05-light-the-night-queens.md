Light the Night raises money for medical research for The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. We will be walking with Key Club members from other high schools in the division, so not only will you be walking for a great cause, but you can also meet many Key Clubbers outside of Stuyvesant!

[Register with our division 11!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kmyTuwOGZ40B_zu4ZP-Aa0IHe1upbHAs_zRajEy3x04)
