We will be helping out at the NYSoM Back to School Supply Drive! The purpose of this drive is to distribute school supplies to benefit students throughout Brooklyn and Harlem. On the 26th, volunteers will be helping with the distribution of school supplies, helping distribute food items from our free bbq for attendees, managing our cultural crafts & information tables, managing concessions (popcorn machine, lemonade) other activities as face painting tattoos and other crafts.
