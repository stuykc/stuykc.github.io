We will be helping out at the NYSoM Back to School Supply Drive! The purpose of this drive is to distribute school supplies to benefit students throughout Brooklyn and Harlem. On the 12th, volunteers will be helping with the distribution of school supplies, managing our Pokemon scavenger hunt and other activities such as face painting, tattoos, and other crafts.
