Each year, thousands of athletes race in the waters of the Hudson River, then bike along the West Side highway in Manhattan, and finally run through Central Park in the final third of the race. To make this race run as smoothly as possible, your help is needed to keep the participants energized. We will be volunteering at AIDS STATION where snacks and drinks are handed out so that the racers can refuel and finish the race!
