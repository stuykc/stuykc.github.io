At our monthly divisional meeting, Key Clubs in Manhattan and Bronx will once again meet to discuss previous and upcoming events in the division! This is a great way to make friends with key clubbers not in our school as well as a great chance to bond with members from our school! ^_^ *highly recommended for new members!*
