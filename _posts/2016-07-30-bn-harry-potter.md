The Barnes & Noble near our school has invited us to their Harry Potter (The Cursed Child) Midnight Release Party! (It doesn't actually go until midnight, but you would have to stay late). They need volunteers to help facilitate activities all night (costume contests, wand dueling, etc). Any volunteer who wants to buy a copy of the new book would be able to do so without having to wait on long lines. Volunteers are also encouraged to dress in house colors, or come in full witch/wizard fashion! 

**This event doesn't need that many volunteers, so we are only accepting 4 on a first come first serve basis.**
