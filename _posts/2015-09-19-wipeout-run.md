From the creators of the actual hit show, this 5k will be filled with obstacles for runners. They'll also be having a festival filled with food vendors in the main area. We will be coordinating day-of registrations, staffing game show-inspired obstacles, manning water stations, bag check, etc. Save the date if you're going!
