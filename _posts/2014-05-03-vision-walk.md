Since its inception in the Spring of 2006, VisionWalk has raised over $28 million to fund sight-saving research. As promising treatments move into critical human studies, the need for research funding is greater than ever. Join the tens of thousands of people who have taken important steps toward a cure by participating in a 5K VisionWalk.
