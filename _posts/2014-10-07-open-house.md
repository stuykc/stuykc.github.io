This special annual event is coming up next Monday and Tuesday. We will be cooperating with Big Sibs, Red Cross, and Arista in giving tours, answering questions, and ushering traffic on the first floor. This event is open to all sophomores, juniors and seniors and runs from 4:15 to 7:00. Yes, food WILL be provided. If you are in any other clubs/groups which are participating in this event, you can get hours for all of them as long as you indicate which ones in the sign up sheet. Finer details will be sent out in a future email. All of us were once scared eighth graders, so we hope you all will take this opportunity to give back to our community!
