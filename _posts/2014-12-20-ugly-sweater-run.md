Dig out your ugly sweater at the bottom of your drawer and help with various tasks, such as checking in participants, passing out goodies, handing out hot chocolate on the course, spreading holiday cheer, and much more. You will receive a comfy beanie and free hot chocolate from the organizers if you sign up with them!
