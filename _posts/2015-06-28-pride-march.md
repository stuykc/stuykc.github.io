NYC Pride is an organization that supports and recognizes the gay and LGBT communities. We'll likely be helping out with crowd control during the march but you should designate whichever volunteer role you'd like in the signup form anyway in case the volunteer coordinator needs it!

**There will be volunteer training sessions held on June 8th, 9th, and 11th (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) from 7:00PM to 9:00PM and on June 13th (Saturday) from 12:00PM to 2:00PM. You must attend one of the training sessions to volunteer. The training sessions will be held at St John's Church at 81 Christopher Street, New York, NY. You will receive hours for attending the training sessions as well.**
