Come to our June Divisional, hosted by our LTG Emily Li! As usual, we will be discussing past and upcoming events, taking part in divisional icebreakers, and listening to update from New York District Key Club! We will be meeting up to attend the divisional as a club after school, so more details will be emailed about that to everyone who signs up to attend the divisional!
