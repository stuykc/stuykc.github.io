Come and help out Chinatown BID with another one of their Weekend Walks aimed at promoting Chinatown and Chinatown businesses! This time we are celebrating the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), so we will be promoting knowledge about that as well as promoting Chinatown in general. During this event we will be helping mostly with setup (moving supplies over, hanging up banners, arranging tables/chair, putting up tents, putting together a stage, carrying over crops, etc), manning the different fun activities, and cleanup!
