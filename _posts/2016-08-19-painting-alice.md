CITYarts invited us to help volunteer with the mural outside of Stuyvesant. If you're interested in painting and making our environment a more beautiful place, sign up! This is an amazing opportunity for Stuy students to leave a mark on their mural! We need about 10-15 volunteers! Red Cross will also be volunteering at this event!
