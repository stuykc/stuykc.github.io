On September 26th, St Judes will be hosting a walk to raise funds for St. Judes Children's Research Hospital. This hospital works to end childhood cancer entirely free of cost. We will assist with tasks such as event set up, breakdown, cheering along the course, etc. Volunteers will be provided with T-shirts and refreshments so come and invite your friends!
