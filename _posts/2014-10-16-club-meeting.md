Come join us at our upcoming meeting. In this meeting we will be handing out the UNICEF Trick-or-Treat boxes to raise money for the ELIMINATE Project. We will be answering all of your questions about this fundraiser at the meeting.  On a different note, we will continue to collect dues from everyone along with selling our awesome T-shirts.
