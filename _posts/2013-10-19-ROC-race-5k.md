The ROC race, dubbed the Ridiculous Obstacle Course race, is an annual race inspired by the popular game show, Wipeout. It combines the craziest obstacles to create the best obstacle course ever. We will be helping with this event by doing bag check, registration, obstacle assistance, and other fun jobs! Food will be provided at this event!
