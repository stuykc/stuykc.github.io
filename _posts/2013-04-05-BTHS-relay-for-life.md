Come to Brooklyn Tech's event to support Relay for Life! There will be awesome activities, exciting performances, speeches, lots of food, a luminaria ceremony to honor those who are battling or have battled cancer, and much more. The **cost to attend is $10** but it is certainly worth it! **You are also encouraged to bring food with you and we'll give you extra points if you do!**
