Volunteers will be working with the CityArts organization and the Painting Club to revive the Alice Wall! We will be scrubbing dirt off the wall, touching up the paint on finished spots, and painting in new scenes. This event is CAPPED at 10 volunteers from Key Club, as we will be working with Red Cross and ARISTA, so sign up quickly!

**In addition, we will probably be using paint that stains clothes, so please dress appropriately!**
