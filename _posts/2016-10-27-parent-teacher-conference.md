Stuyvesant ARISTA, Red Cross, and Key Club will be rewarding credits for volunteering for Parent Teacher Conferences. On the PTC website, you may indicate your preferences for the teacher you want to help. If you have been asked by a teacher to be their helper ensure that you have an account at ptc.stuyarista.org. If you do not have an account, your teacher will not be able to request you. Please indicate that you are part of Key Club in "Your Information" view. We will be helping teachers out with checking parents in and timing meetings. You can request specific teachers under the same tab, but make sure you ask them in advance.
