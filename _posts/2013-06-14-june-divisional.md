This Divisional Meeting will be an opportunity for you to take a breath and relax right before/during your exams. It will be our last one before you guys are off for the summer. Seniors will be graduating, and those of us staying will see fresh new faces in the fall. Also, details about the postponed DTC (date moved to August), ICON, and the Divisional BBQ will be discussed.

**Please note this will be the last event of the service year! After that will be Induction where you will get your certificates, bond with other Key Clubbers, and celebrate the success of another service year. Therefore, if anyone is still short of their 25 hours, please come!**
