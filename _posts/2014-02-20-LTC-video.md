This year, one of the many awards we are applying for at LTC is the Video Contest Award. Our Web/Video committee chair, Stanley Lok, needs as many Key Clubbers as possible to participate so he can get enough clips to put together the video. Come participate, have a little fun, and show the New York District your Stuyvesant Key Club pride!
