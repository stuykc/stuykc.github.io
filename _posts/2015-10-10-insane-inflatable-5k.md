We'll be helping out at a 5k filled with fun inflatable obstacles. Volunteers will be doing a variety of tasks, including manning water stations, crowd control, setup, etc. You'll also receive lunch and access to the games in the festival area.  If our club sends more than 10 volunteers, the event organizers will donate $50 for each person that attends!
