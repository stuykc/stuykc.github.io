Chinatown Partnership will be holding its first ever Shared Streets program with the NYC Dept. of Transportation! Mott Street will be transformed into a magical nighttime destination as pedestrians will be allowed to take a walk, dine, or play board games under a canopy of lights. Volunteers will be assisting in setting up, answering visitor questions and helping everyone have a great time!
