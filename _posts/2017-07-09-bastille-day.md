We'll be helping out at the Bastille Day.  Volunteers will help with set-up in the morning, working an activities station, giving information, passing out programs, or selling tickets from FIAF booths.The day is a lot of fun but also a lot of work so please be sure you are in good shape to be outdoors on a hot July afternoon!
