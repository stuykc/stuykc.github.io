The Komen Greater NYC Race for the Cure is the premier fundraiser that raises significant funds and awareness for the fight against breast cancer, celebrates survivorship, and honors those who have lost their battle with the disease. We will be helping to make this event a success through keeping it running smoothly and through spreading the word of the event.
