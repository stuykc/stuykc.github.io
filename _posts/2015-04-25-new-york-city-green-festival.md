For this event we'll be working with Stuyvesant Environmental Club! We'll help by staffing resource recovery stations, educating attendees about recycling and composting, and maximizing compost and recycling efforts. Feel free to sign up for all three shifts! 

**We will be working on the green team shifts. Please look through this [volunteer handbook](http://goo.gl/efU9f3) and sign this [waiver](http://goo.gl/cycoIu).**
