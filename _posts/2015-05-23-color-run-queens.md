The Color Run Queens is an event to promote healthiness and happiness by bringing the community together to participate in the “Happiest 5k on the Planet”. Each Color Run raises money for a different charity. The Color Run Queens will be raising money for Back on My Feet, a charity that raises money to help those experiencing homelessness. Volunteer tasks include handing out water , revving up the crowd, and throwing powdered color (corn starch) at runners. If you want to throw corn starch at the crowd, you'll have to arrive early since volunteer positions are first come first serve! We have 20 available spots for this event!
