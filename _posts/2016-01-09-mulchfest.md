We will be helping NYC parks spread mulch in Carl Schwartz Park to help insulate these trees from the cold weather, retain moisture, and provide a decorative addition to neighborhood blocks. You can also pick up bags of mulch to take home with you and use on the trees on your trees. Volunteer tree stewardship activities will include picking up litter and spreading mulch.

**Also, please be sure to sign up [here](https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship/1295) and remember to choose Carl Schurz Park!**
