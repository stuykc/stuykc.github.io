Division 11 will be hosting our 4th Annual BBQ. This event is going to be almost three times as big. There several events including games, officer auctions, and prizes. Everyone is invited! There is a $12 admission fee. All proceeds will be donated to the Eliminate Project. Remember Water Guns are fair play.
