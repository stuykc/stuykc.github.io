Together with Brooklyn Tech High School and Midwood High School, we planned a friendship event to celebrate our successful 2015-2016 service year and to get to know each school's key club better! Day 1 will be a fun day where we celebrate with food and drinks in Central Park as we thank the old board and welcome the new board. There will be games and opportunities to connect with new friends.
