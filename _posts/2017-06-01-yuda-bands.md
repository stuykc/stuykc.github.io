Want to help out at Key Club's first fundraiser of the year? Want to help raise money that will go towards children in Guatemala? If so, come help sell YUDA bands during your lunch period and/or frees!
-What are YUDA bands?
They're bracelets handmade in Guatemala. These bracelets not only provide jobs for the YUDA band makers who made these 100% Fair-Trade bracelets (out of repurposed coconut shells and leather!) but all money made will be going towards providing an opportunity for children to receive the education they deserve!
