CPC has invited us to volunteer in their first annual 3-on-3 Basketball tournament. We will be helping them as score keepers, time keepers, and slam dunk contest judges. There will also be other assignments which will be sent out in more detail later on. If you're into playing basketball, you can also sign up as participants of the tournament here (deadline is the July 24th, 2015): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VXUbjhVCKN8U-RtPDlETpTpNt76TkzFWYFEwjUoCtFI/viewform
