The Damon Runyon Research Foundation will be hosting the first charitable fundraiser at the newly constructed 4 World Trade Center! Since Stuy is located so close by, we should have no problem with helping after school. We will be assisting with distributing t-shirts, manning the food table and cheering the runners as they climb up the stairs of the 7th tallest building in NYC!
