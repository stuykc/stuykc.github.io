Come help volunteer at the annual AIDS Walk to help raise money for GMHC, the worldâ€™s first and leading provider of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and advocacy!  This is one of our largest events of the year and we encourage you all to join us. We will be volunteering as crowd control, in which we will welcome walkers as they enter Central Park and be part of the excitement at the start and finish line of AIDS Walk New York! Let's all have fun and cheer people on!
