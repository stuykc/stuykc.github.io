We will be helping out Hester Street Fair with their 7th annual Grub Street Food Festival! With over 50 food vendors, it truly will be a celebration of the variety that makes this cityâ€™s eating scene so incredible. Volunteers will be helping out with setup, breakdown as well as any tasks the food vendors request.
