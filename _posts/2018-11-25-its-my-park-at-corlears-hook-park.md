Volunteers will help clean the park by raking and bagging leaves that will then be sent to the Lower East Side Ecology Center for composting. Tools, gloves, and equipment will be supplied. People should wear comfortable clothes that they would not mind getting a little dirty and bring minimal personal belongings.
