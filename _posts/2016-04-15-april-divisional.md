<b>Club Meeting</b>: We'll be discussing about our events, what happened at LTC, and applying to be committee heads! It's also right before our April Divisional (it's finally at Stuy again), so you guys should stick around for both!!

<b>Divisional</b>: Come to the first divisional of the new service year! We will be talking about LTC, upcoming events and projects, and much more. There will also be a raffle with various prizes such as gift cards (Chipotle, Shake Shack, Sports Authority) and a bunch of Key Club swag. Hope to see y'all there!
