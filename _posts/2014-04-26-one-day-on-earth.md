With the onset of Earth Day, we will be helping Chinatown Partnership with their annual Earth Day event, to spread awareness that the world we live on needs to be cared for. We will be around Chinatown, cleaning, advocating, and participating in festivities that show we care about the Earth. The Chinatown Partner ship needs a lot of help and all of their previous events have all been extremely successful and fun!
