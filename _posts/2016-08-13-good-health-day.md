We will be helping out at the Good Health Day fair. This event is open to the public and will feature several different organizations sharing educational information to the public. There will also be fun activities such as face painting, balloon animals, clowns, aerobics, music and other cultural performances. Please sign up especially if you can speak Korean or Mandarin as you will be helping to communicate with non-english speaking patrons. Lunch will also be provided!
