Stuyvesant will be having its Spring Open House! The kids visiting this time will be incoming freshmen (do you remember when we were that young?) This event is for Juniors and Seniors only! You will be giving tours, answering questions, and helping out with crowd control. Food will be provided in the form of  🍕!
