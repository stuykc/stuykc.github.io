MG is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by fluctuating weakness of muscle groups.  Volunteers will be helping out at the MG walk, which aims to raise funds and awareness towards this order. Volunteers will be checking in walkers, acting as route marshals, face painting and managing food and beverages.
