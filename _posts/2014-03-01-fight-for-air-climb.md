Fight for Air Climb is the American Lung Associationâ€™s most unique fundraiser. Teams and individual participants will be running up hundreds of steps and can use the event as a fitness target, as a race, or as a great way to be active and meet new friends. We will be volunteering at this event by helping with registration, cheering on the racers, escorting them to the nearest elevator if necessary, and making sure the event runs smoothly in general.
