The Division Training Conference is one of the largest events of the service year. Not only will you be able to learn about Key Club, but you will get to meet Key Clubbers not only from our home Division 11, but from Divisions 8 and 8A. There will be guest speakers, handouts and presentation materials, and over 15 workshops. There is an admission fee of $10, which includes lunch.
