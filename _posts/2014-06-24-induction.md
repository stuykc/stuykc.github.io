Come to this end of the year ceremony to bond with Key Clubbers, get your certificates, and be recognized for your accomplishments! There will be farewells from the old cabinet and special guests, as well as plenty of food! The price of the food will be $10. Even if you did not reach the hours requirement or are not a Key Clubber or from Stuyvesant, you are welcome to attend, so bring your friends (: The more, the merrier!
