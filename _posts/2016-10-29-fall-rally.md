The annual Fall Rally will be held at Stuy! This is one of the largest and best events of the year as Key Clubbers from across New York will be attending. There will be a large icebreaker, the Kfair, for Key Clubbers to get to know each. There will also be an orientation on developing leadership skills as a club officer. This event will require attendees to dress business casual and the admission price is $8 for both food and refreshments!
