Come help set up, cheer for the performers, enjoy the show, and help with clean up. The event starts at 3 PM, but we know most of you leave school at 3:30 PM, so just try to get there as soon as possible, definitely by 4:00 PM. If you have a DSLR camera to take photos of the event or can help record the performances, please indicate in the comment section of the sign-up sheet!
