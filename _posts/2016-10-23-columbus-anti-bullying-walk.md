In honor of the National Bullying Awareness Month, the Kiwanis Family will be bringing awareness to the issue of bullying and its prevention. We will be joining New York District of Kiwanis International in marching and rallying alongside elected officials, neighborhood leaders, clergy, community leaders, and school officials. We will be meeting at 11 at City Hall Park in Manhattan, and begin marching across the Brooklyn Bridge at 12. The rally held after the march at Columbus Park in Brooklyn will begin at 1:15 and end at 3:30.
