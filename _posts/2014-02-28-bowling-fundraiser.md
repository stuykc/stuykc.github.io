We will be bowling at Melody Lanes for our upcoming fundraiser! It will cost $20 for 2 hours of unlimited bowling including shoe rental. However, the more people who go, the cheaper it will be, so bring your friends (it's more fun to bowl with friends anyways)! People from outside of Stuyvesant Key Club may come as well!  
We will be leaving together after elections!
