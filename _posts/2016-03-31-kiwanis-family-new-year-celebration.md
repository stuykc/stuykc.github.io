Ring in the new service year in style! New York District Circle K invites you, our Kiwanis Family, to a New Year Celebration on March 31st! You've worked so hard this past year and now it's time to celebrate! Come join us at Sweet Spot to celebrate the 2015-2016 service year and the start of the 2016-2017 service year. Everyone is invited, so Key Clubbers, Circle K'ers, Kiwanians and any guests you want can join in on the festivities!

**The dress code is semi-formal, and the cost of admission is $10. All proceeds will go to the Kiwanis Pediatric Lyme Disease Foundation. Key Clubbers are welcome to leave early because it's a school night. Please RSVP for this event by March 30th at 12:00PM.
