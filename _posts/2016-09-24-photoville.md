We'll be helping out at the 5th annual Photoville located on the Brooklyn Waterfront! Photoville is a massive and unique photographic event that showcases over sixty exhibitions of photos taken around the globe in shipping containers. They aim to connect photographers and their audience through the power of visual storytelling. In addition, there will be multiple activities for volunteers and visitors to participate in such as the NY Times Photo Hunt and the Daylight Book Signing Event. There will also be an orientation prior to the event, details TBA. Photoville will also provide you with a food voucher to redeem at one of the yummy Smorgasburg food vendors! Since the last shift ends a bit late, you will be able to leave early if necessary.
