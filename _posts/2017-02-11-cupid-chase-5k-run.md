We will be helping with Cupid Chase 5k Run. There will be runners, walkers, and rollers (baby strollers and wheelchairs) to help make a difference in the lives of people with disabilities by participating in our annual Cupidâ€™s Chase 5K Fundraiser. Volunteers will help with water station, course marshal, gear check, refreshment etc.
