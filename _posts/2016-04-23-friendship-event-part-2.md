Day 2 is the same event as the 5th Annual Earth Day Celebration at Kimlau Square! We will be doing this event with Brooklyn Tech and Midwood, so why not get to know them better on our Day 1 event as well? If you would like to do both events, you do not have to also find and fill out the other form for the 5th Annual Earth Day Celebration.
