We will be volunteering at Imagine Science Film Festival! Volunteers help with set up, admittance to the festival, take down, and monitoring the events. In addition, volunteers get free access to all festival events! They are also looking for volunteers to help photograph and film the events! If you would like to help with photograph/film, just tell us in the comment section!
