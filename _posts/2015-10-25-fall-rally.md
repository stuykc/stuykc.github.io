Fall Rally is one of the largest events of the service year. Not only will you be able to learn about Key Club, but you will also have the opportunity to meet Key Clubbers from other divisions. Keep in mind that this Fall Rally is for Divisions 1 through 7, but you can still go if you are interested in finding out more about the New York District!
