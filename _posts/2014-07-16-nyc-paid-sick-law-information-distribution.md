We will be partnering with Chinatown Partnership and local city council member Margaret Chin help spread information out about the new NYC Paid Sick law by passing out fliers and conducting surveys of people passing by.  If you have a Chinatown BID t-shirt from past events, please make sure to wear it when volunteering.
