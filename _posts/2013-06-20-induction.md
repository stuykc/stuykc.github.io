Come to this end of the year ceremony to bond with Key Clubbers, get your certificates, and be recognized for your accomplishments! There will be plenty of food and speeches by the old and new cabinet. This year, we will not only be presenting certificates for Key Clubbers with 25+ hours, but giving out special certificates for people who have done exemplary work, so come! Who knows, you just may be one of them (:

**COST:** <span style="color:#FF0000;">If you paid your dues at any point this year, the cost is $9! The cost for anyone who did not pay dues or is not in Key Club is $10!</span> Money will be collected throughout regents week.

- You **WILL** receive some hours for Induction, and it'll give you a head start for the 2013-2014 service year.
- You don't have to wear anything fancy for Induction. Casual is fine, but not too shabby. Think of how you'll dress if it's the first day of school. You'll want to look good, right? ;)
