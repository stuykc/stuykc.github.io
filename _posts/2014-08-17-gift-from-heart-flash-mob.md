We will be helping raise awareness to Downs Syndrome which affects a large amount of people by participating in a flash mob.  We will also help fulfill a girl's wish of a flash mob who is suffering from Downs Syndrome.  This is unlike most events where you will be participating in a flash mob that involves dancing.  A video will be uploaded and sent out later to participants to practice the moves needed.
