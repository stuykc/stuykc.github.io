We will be helping raise awareness to Downs Syndrome which affects a large amount of people by participating in a flash mob.  We will also help fulfill a girl's wish of a flash mob who is suffering from Downs Syndrome.  This is unlike most events where you will be participating in a flash mob that involves dancing.  Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFuwvKsEkTc&feature=youtu.be) for you to watch and practice the dance moves.
