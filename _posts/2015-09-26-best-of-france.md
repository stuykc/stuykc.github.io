This event will be a festival celebrating all things French, and is perfect for the francophiles out there. You will be needed for a variety of activities, including vendors, entrance, restocking, etc. If you are doing the last shift, you can leave a little earlier if you need to. The weather should be pretty nice during the event, so save the date if are planning to go.
