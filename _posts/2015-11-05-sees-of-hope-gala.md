We'll be helping NAMI-NYC with their annual awards gala. Volunteer roles include greeting guests, ushering, crowd control, silent auction set up, live auction assistance, and checkout. Although this event ends a little later, you may be able to leave a little earlier.

**You must also wear all black attire. Free pizza dinner is included!**
