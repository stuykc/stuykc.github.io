We'll be helping Puppetry Arts with their annual Halloween carnival. Volunteer roles include running crafts, game stations, giving gift bags, and working the Haunted House. Because we're there as volunteers, try to refrain from playing with your phone too often. Lunch will be provided; costumes are encouraged.
