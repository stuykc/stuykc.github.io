We'll be helping out at the CPLDC/Chinatown B.I.D Lunar New Year Celebration. Volunteers will be starting out in Chinatown and ending on Madison Ave!! This year we will be celebrating the Year of the Dog and guess what? Dogs will be involved, from a dog parade to dog adoptions. It's going to be a guaranteed fun day.
