Join over 5,000 New Yorkers in the city’s largest walk to support mental health and fight the stigma people affected by mental illness and their families face every day. Proceeds fund NAMI’s no-cost support, education, and advocacy programs for families and individuals living with mental illness. We will be checking in at 9 AM and start walking at 10 AM.
