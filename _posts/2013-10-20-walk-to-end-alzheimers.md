Walk to End Alzheimer's is the nation’s largest event to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer’s care, support and research. We will be volunteering at this event. The Alzheimer's Association is actually one of the New York District Key Club's (NYDKC) district projects this year. Therefore, we highly recommend you to come, as it means a lot to Key Club and because you are supporting this great cause.
