At Asphalt Green, kids will be dressed up in costumes as they participate in Halloween-themed events. These include games such as Zombie Freeze Tag, Spooktacular Soccer Shootout, and many more! We will be volunteering to overlook these activities as well as setting up, decorating cookies/bags, and cleanup.
