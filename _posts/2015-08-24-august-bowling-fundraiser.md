We will be bowling at Melody Lanes for our upcoming fundraiser! It will cost $20 for 2 hours of unlimited bowling including shoe rental. However, the more people who go, the cheaper it will be, so bring your friends (it's more fun to bowl with friends anyway)! People from outside of Stuyvesant Key Club may come as well. The more the merrier :D. The date is August 24th from 2pm to 4 pm. The price will go down as more people join so the final price will be sent on August 14th! Thanks for coming (* ^ 0 ^ *) !!
