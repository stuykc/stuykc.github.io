We will be teaming up with Stuyvesant Red Cross and Stuyvesant ARISTA to help run the annual Goddard Community Center Book Fair. We will be selling books to people so make sure that you are enthusiastic and willing to interact with people that you have never met before. There are limited spots for this event as the community center wants to place volunteers in sections that they care about.
