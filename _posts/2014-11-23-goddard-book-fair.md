We will be teaming up with Stuyvesant Red Cross and Stuyvesant ARISTA to help run the annual Goddard Community Center Book Fair. We will be selling books to people so make sure that you are enthusiastic and willing to interact with people that you have never met before. There are limited spots for this event as the community center wants to place volunteers in sections that they care about. If you have already signed up for this event from the last email you should be fine. However, if you want hours from Red Cross or ARISTA, you must sign up again and hope that there's space for you. Just like the Book Fair Sorting, we will send out an email to volunteers that are chosen with a form at a later date. If you want to be a project captain for Saturday, just email us.
