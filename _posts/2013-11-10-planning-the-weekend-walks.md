Weekend Walks are events held by a community to showcase the best parts of it. Just [this June]({% post_url 2013-06-02-chinatown-weekend-walk %}), we helped Chinatown BID with their first weekend walk to make it a success! They are now preparing for the weekend walks happening next year and they plan to make it A LOT bigger! So come tomorrow to help with the planning stage of it all.
