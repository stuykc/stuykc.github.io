We'll be helping NYRR out at their half-marathon. Volunteers will be setting up the fluid station tables, pouring water, and keeping the area clear. The weather will probably have warmed up by the event date, so it'll be much more enjoyable. Don't let the early time discourage you from attending! 

You <b>must</b> also sign up on the NYRR website by <b>February 28th</b> using the instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B27xy3_LFsTlWXBaaHRZM3JaOWNXcWdOenpwMmlwSElNYl9N/view).
