Help with gift wrapping at Barnes & Nobles for those who want to buy gifts for their loved ones over the holidays! We will help gift wrap for those with receipts, and hopefully they'll make donations for charity. Lunch and dinner will be provided for all volunteers by 5 Guys Burgers (vegetarian available), and you will even be entertained by children's puppet shows.
