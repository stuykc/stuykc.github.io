We will be helping out at Taste Talks. Volunteers mainly will be located at the All-Star BBQ. Volunteers will be checking off peoples' menu cards at each chef station and/or being a "floater" to assist with any needs that come up during the event. Remember to fill out the waiver (will be given in confirmation email)!
