Come volunteer with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at this climb up 66 flights of stairs to the Top of the Rock Observation Deck in Rockefeller Center.  We will set up the tables, chairs, and materials to prepare for registration. During the race, we will support and cheer on the climbers as they make their way up 66 flights of stairs.
