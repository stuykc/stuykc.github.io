We are helping the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention at their NYC walk! Suicide is a prevalent problem in our country, and it is not the solution to people's problems. We want people to understand this, and so, let's make sure that this walk is successful and brings awareness to this ongoing problem! Jobs will include walk setup, passing out food, cheering on the walkers and cleaning up!

**You must fill out [this waiver form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B27xy3_LFsTlSy00UmxOVUZQZDg/edit) and bring it to the event!**
