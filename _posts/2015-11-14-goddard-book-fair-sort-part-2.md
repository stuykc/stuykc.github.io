We'll be helping with sorting in preparation for the Goddard Book Fair again. In case you weren't there for the first sorting, we basically sorted/organized books into their genres.

**Also, please be sure to sign up [here](https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/WebLink.aspx?name=E165152&id=50&formid=501&Preview=true) and only check the 14th!**
