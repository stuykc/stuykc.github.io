This festival is to kick off the year of the Take Steps Walks that will be going on throughout the nation. This is a cause that is to benefit and find cures for those suffering from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The festival will be be complete with food, games, and lots of entertainment! Participants will also be able to walk along the Brooklyn Bridge. We will be helping out with this event in setting up the festival, running the booths, guiding walkers on the route, and breaking down. This is a great event for those that enjoy the night light of the Brooklyn Bridge and that of the city.
