We'll be wrapping and decorating donated presents to be given families receiving services from City Santa and Coalition for the Homeless.

**Volunteers should bring a roll of wrapping paper. If you don't have wrapping paper, we might be able to provide. Just sign up if you're interested and think you'll be able to come! This event is CAPPED at 10 volunteers.**
