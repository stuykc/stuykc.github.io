We will be working at stations located on the 1st and 2nd floor entrances, as well as in traveling groups, selling three different products: 1) Icing Smiles Pens for $3, 2) Baked goods at $1 a piece, and 3) $5 Goodie bags for teachers. The money raised from the baked goods and the Icing Smiles merchandise will be donated to the Icing Smiles, an organization dedicated to baking cakes for children with critical illnesses. All donations from our goodie bags will proceed to the relief of Hurricane Matthew victims. We need many volunteers to make our fundraisers successful so please do consider helping out! Confirmation emails will be sent out later on tonight, but you are basically accepted and expected to volunteer on the shifts you signed up for.
