In preparation for the annual Goddard Community Center Book Fair, we will teaming up with Stuyvesant Red Cross and Stuyvesant ARISTA to help sort and prepare books for the book sale. If you do sign up for this event, make sure that you won't mind leaving late at night and that you are 100% able to go. There are limited spots available for Stuyvesant students to help out. We will send out an email a form to volunteers that are chosen at a later time.
