We will be volunteering with the Kiwanis Club of NYC Young Professionals for the New York Cares Day. We will be painting murals and organizing classrooms. In order to attend the event, the New York Cares organization requests that a $25 donation be made for supplies (You will be volunteering and donating at the same time!). NYC Young Professionals Kiwanis Club has volunteered to subsidize the cost of attending. Instead of $25, you will need to donate only $12.50 to attend.

To register, please email our LTG Aaron at aaroncheung.ltg@nydkc.org with your name, email address, phone number, school and birthday.
