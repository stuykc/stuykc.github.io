October Divisional might be the first divisional for many of you! We encourage you to join so that you can know more about Key Club and our division. At the divisional, you will get the information about the upcoming divisional events. The divisional is also a good chance for all of you to meet some Key Clubbers from other high schools in NYC and have fun with them!
