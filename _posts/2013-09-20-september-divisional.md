The September Divisional is the first divisional of the school year, so we will be discussing plans for the future such as Key Club projects and events. In addition, this will be the perfect opportunity to meet Key Clubbers from outside of just Stuyvesant Key Club and bond with them! Key Clubs from around NYC will be there, so we encourage you all to attend! Also, there will be food! :D
