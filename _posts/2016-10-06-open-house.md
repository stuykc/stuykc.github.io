**Seniors & Juniors**

We will be needing as much help as possible for this event! As you may expect or even remember, thousands of people come to Open House and will be requiring tour guides. Volunteers will be giving tours from floor to floor to middle schoolers and their parents. Open house has always been a very rewarding event to volunteer in AND we will be offering food in the form of boxed lunches and/or üçï!

If you are in ARISTA, your account is pre-made!!!
