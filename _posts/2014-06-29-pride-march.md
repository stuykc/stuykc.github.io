NYC Pride is an organization that supports and recognizes the gay and LGBT communities. We will be helping out with the march that is organized that day. This means that we're volunteering along the sidelines, assisting the walkers and keeping the crowds under control. We won't be marching in the parade, but who needs to march when you can volunteer? :)
