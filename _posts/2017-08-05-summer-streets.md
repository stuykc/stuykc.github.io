On the first three Saturdays in August, from the Brooklyn Bridge to Central Park, 7 miles of streets will be closed to cars for six hours to allow walkers, runners, cyclists and people of all ages to take back the streets and enjoy many free activities along the route. Volunteers need to be 16 years of age or older and be able to work outside in the variable weather. All volunteers will receive a commemorative shirt and goodie bag packed with great gifts and snacks from sponsors. Please sign up by July 25th!
