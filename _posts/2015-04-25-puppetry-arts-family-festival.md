We'll be working with Puppetry Arts, who hosted one of our recent events, Taste of 5th Avenue. For this event we will be helping out with crafts, games, the bounce house, and more! They will also be feeding us, so look forward to that!

**This event is on the same day as the New York City Green Festival.**
