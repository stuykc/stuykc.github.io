This year, Key Club will be walking with Chinatown Kiwanis in the annual Chinese New Year Parade! The parade will be looping around Chinatown, starting at Mott Street and finishing off on Grand Street. Chinatown Kiwanis is our sponsoring Kiwanis club, so we highly encourage you guys to come to the event! Also, it's just cool to march in the parade and have all those strangers cheering us on!

<i>If you are members of another school's Key Club, you can attend the event with us! Just put in the 4-digit ID space the name of your school.</i>
