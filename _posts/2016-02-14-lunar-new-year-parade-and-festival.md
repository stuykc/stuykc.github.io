Better Chinatown Society will be hosting their annual Lunar New Year celebrations will be held all throughout February this year! Sunday, February 14 is the 17th Annual New Year Parade in Chinatown. We will be setting up and walking with the organization that is backbone of it all: Better Chinatown. In past years, we handed out flyers and freebies, shot off confetti sticks at passing floats, and interacted with tourists and celebrity guests before the parade. You won't want to miss this!
