**Price will be announced on a later date, but it will most likely be 10 dollars.**

Join members of Stuyvesant and other Division 11 Key Clubs for a morning/afternoon of fun, Key Club love, bonding with your divisional officers, and Hunger Games fangirling. In all seriousness, proceeds go to the Eliminate Project, and the event will be incredibly fun for a cheap price, so please consider attending! You may bring non-Key Clubbers to the event as well, but please have them sign up on the form.
