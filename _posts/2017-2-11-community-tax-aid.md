We will be helping out Community Tax Aid every Saturday from February to April. CTA prepares tax returns, free of charge, to deserving low income taxpayers. Since the taxpayers speak Chinese, they asked us for translators who can fluently speak either Mandarin or Cantonese. This event would be extremely rewarding to CTA, Stuyvesant and to the community. This experience from this event also just sounds like it can make for a quality college essay.
