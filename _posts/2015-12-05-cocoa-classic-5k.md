We'll be helping NYCRUNS at their winter run on Roosevelt Island. This event will have plenty of hot cocoa for participants to enjoy. Volunteer roles include water stations, bag check, refreshments, etc. If you sign up, please make sure you're available that day, and please email us if something comes up and you can't go.
