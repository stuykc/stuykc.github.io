We'll be helping out a group of lion dancers as they travel around Chinatown! Volunteers will be flag bearers/runners and will ultimately make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible. Bonus: you might get red envelopes :) and extra hours will be awarded by the organization **CAPPED AT 15**
