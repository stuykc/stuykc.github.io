Community Options Inc is hosting their annual Annual Cupidâ€™s Chase 5k Run to help raise money for housing and support to people with disabilities. We will be helping with registration before the race begins at 10AM. After, we will hand out food and water, cheer on walkers, and maintain crowd control.
