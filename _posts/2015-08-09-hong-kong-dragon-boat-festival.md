We will also be helping out with the annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in Flushing Meadows Park! Volunteers will being helping out with everything from basic set up and clean up to handling the boats, directing traffic, and marshaling teams. There will be two shifts per day: one in the morning from 7AM to 1PM and one in the evening from 12PM to 6PM. It is not required to volunteer both days and you may sign up for as many shifts as you want! The festival will provide round trip bus transportation from Downtown Flushing to the festival site at key times for volunteers. More information will be provided about this later. In addition, lunch will be provided for those who work both shifts and t-shirts will be given to those who work multiple shifts.

**We are participating in this event with both Red Cross and ARISTA!**
