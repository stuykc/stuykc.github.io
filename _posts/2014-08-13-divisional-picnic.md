Come join the rest of Division 11 as we gather for our monthly divisional meeting where we meet fellow key clubbers to discuss our past events and activities.  Instead of a normal divisional meeting, this will be a picnic gathering in the evening so bring your friends for some food and fun.

Admission: $5 Regular, $1 Dollar if you bring food
