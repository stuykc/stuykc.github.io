Come to this event to cool off and hang out with your Key Club friends as well as Key Clubbers across NYC to enjoy hot dogs, burgers, and other BBQ classics! If you would like, we can also have a water fight! Be sure to bring water balloons and water guns, or if you'd rather stay dry, a volleyball and frisbee would be fun too!

**Please bring in $10 for BBQ admission at the June Divisional; if you cannot come to the divisional, have a friend hand in the money for you.**
