Come to our monthly divisional meeting in which all key clubs from NY District 11 will meet and discuss past, current, and future events within the division! This divisional is the last divisional before LTC (our district convention), so come learn more about LTC and come say farewell to our current LTG (Lieutenant Governor) Aaron Cheung! We will most likely be meeting up to go to the divisional together after school, so make sure to check your emails Thursday night for a confirmation email with further details on where/when to meet up!
