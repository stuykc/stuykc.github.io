We will be walking with Chinatown Kiwanis, our sponsoring Kiwanis organization, in annual Chinese New Year Parade! The parade will be looping around Chinatown! Last year, we got Chinese New Year money (red envelope!) from Chinatown Kiwanis. There will be free Key Club caps too (they're super cute)! Please sign up ASAP if you would like to participate in the walk! We need lots of volunteers for this event!!
