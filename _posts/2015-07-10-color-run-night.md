This event will be ending really late so you guys can leave a bit earlier if you need to! The Color Run Night will be raising funds for CCBF, an organization dedicated to the care of children with cancer and blood disorders. Like the previous Color Run, activities will be helping with set up and throwing colored corn starch at runners.
