Here are some updates from this year's Key Club International Convention. A Key Club cannot be chartered in a school or community center in which another Key Club already exists. Also, the club and district webmasters are officially recognized positions. 

The 2015-2016 Key Club International President is **Rip Livingston** from the Alabama District and the International Vice President is **Addison Clipfell** from the Michigan District! Also, shoutout to **Clifford Young** and **Heather Farley** who were elected as International Trustees! 

There is a newly released Key Club app that might help you organize service projects! Essentially, the app allows club officers to input various service projects and club meetings. Then, club members can RSVP for projects and even check-in when they arrive at the service project site. This makes it easy for club officers to keep track of who signed up for events, who showed up, and for how long they stayed. Go check that out!
