Come help translate for teachers and parents during P.S 124's Spring parent-teacher-conference! We always have a lot of fun at this event, and it will be a great way to practice your Mandarin or Cantonese skills! You can also meet cute little kids if you're into that!

**You must fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese to volunteer at this event.**
**It is not required for you to stay this late, but it is preferable that you can, as it would be good to have consistency.**
