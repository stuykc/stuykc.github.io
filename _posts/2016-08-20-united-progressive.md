We will be helping out Assemblyman Bill Colton, Councilman Mark Treyger, and District Leaders Nancy Tong and Charles Ragusa, in conducting a neighborhood clean-up event sponsored by the United Progressive Young Democrats Club of the 47th Assembly District. The goal is to clean up the streets around 86th Street, Bay Parkway, Benson Avenue, and Bath Avenue. 

<b>Free pizza</b> will be provided!
