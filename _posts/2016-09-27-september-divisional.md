At the divisional, you'll get a chance to meet Key Clubbers from other schools in Manhattan and the Bronx as well as hear the volunteer events they have been to and future, upcoming events! Stuyvesant Key Club is a Division 11 Key Club along with schools including Bronx Science, LaGuardia, Hunter, and HSMSE. We hope to see you all there!
