Summer Streets is an annual celebration of New York City’s most valuable public space—our streets. Summer Streets provides space for healthy recreation and encourages New Yorkers to use more sustainable forms of transportation. There will be various activities such as zip-lining, dancing, and biking. You will be marshalling the route, directing participants, and helping thousands of New Yorkers enjoy Summer Streets - and you'll have a great time too!
