The Divisional Events Committee aims to plan events to further the goals of Key Club International. Specifically, the committee plans and executes fundraisers to raise funds for charities. However, this is no easy feat, and requires the best and the brightest. Do not be discouraged as anyone can join, all you need is to show dedication as we will train you to be a master at the art of events planning.

**We will be accepting a limited number of people now, but once the school year begins, we will be accepting more so don't stress if you do not get it this time around. Past committee members MUST reapply.**
