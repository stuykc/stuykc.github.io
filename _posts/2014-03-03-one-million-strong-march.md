One Million Strong is a movement raising awareness of colorectal cancer. It’s inspired by the one million colorectal cancer survivors and those who’ve shown tremendous strength in light of the disease. They are kicking off the campaign at 9 AM, but since we have school, we will leave immediately after 10th period (or whenever your school day ends) and arrive asap. From 4-6 PM, the group will be leaving Grand Central to march to Times Square, so it would be perfect for us to man the exhibit during this time. When you arrive, check in at the registration table in the back near the stage. We will be manning either the Educational Resources or Outreach Team stations.
