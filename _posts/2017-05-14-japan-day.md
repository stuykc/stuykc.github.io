Japan Day will have food and activity tents as well as a stage program displaying a wide range of Japanese culture so be sure to come! Last year we helped out with t shirt tents and crowd control. The year before that we helped out at the Yukata and Calligraphy tents but we may be assigned different roles this year. If you're interested in this event, please sign up and send your signed waiver to newprojects@stuykc.org. PLEASE SIGN UP AND SEND US YOUR WAIVER BY WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12TH AT 3PM LATEST! YOU CANNOT GO TO THE EVENT WITHOUT SENDING US YOUR WAIVER!
