We will be helping CYI (Chinatown Youth Initiatives) clean the streets of Chinatown! CBD is a great way for volunteers to feel more involved in the community as well as meet new people. But most of all, it's a reminder of the importance of one's civic duty to their community and how we must all take care of each other!! There is also an optional Chinatown Beautificaion Day Youth Conference on Satuday August 8th, but the sign up link for that has not been announced yet. For more information about the conference or this event, you should visit their FB event page [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1642536889323872/).
