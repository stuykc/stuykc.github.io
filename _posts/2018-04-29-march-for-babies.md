Nearly half a million babies are born premature or with birth defects in the U.S. each year. March of Dimes is an organization aimed at providing aid for babies, as well as mothers and fathers around the world. Volunteers will actually be marching 3 miles to raise awareness and funds for this amazing cause. Make sure you join our team and if this is your first time, you will need to create an account, which is really easy and after, just join the NYDKC Division 11 Team and you are good to go!
**WE WILL BE MEETING UP AT THE GLASS STAIRCASE AT ALICE TULLY HALL WITH THE REST OF DIVISION 11**
