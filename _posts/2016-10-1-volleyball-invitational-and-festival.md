Better Chinatown is helping out TaiShan Organizational Group host the First Chinese American Volleyball Invitational and Festival. Volunteers are needed to help with setting up, distributing food and goodies, and breaking down. Volunteers will be entered in a raffle for either a Hong Kong ticket or a domestic ticket. The more hours you volunteer for, the more raffle tickets you get!!
