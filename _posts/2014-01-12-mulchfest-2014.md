Mulchfest is back for another year of recycling trees! Sponsored by the Parks department, this event is meant to repurpose Christmas trees that would otherwise be dumped into landfills. By turning trees into mulch, not only is the environment being saved, but also plants can be covered at the base with mulch to help them grow. Although we won't be the ones chipping trees and turning them into mulch, we will be assisting the parks department as well as spreading awareness of the benefits of mulch!
