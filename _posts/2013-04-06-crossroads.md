A crossroad represents a point at which a crucial decision must be made that will have far reaching consequences. As of the 2005 census, almost 15 million Americans identify as Asian or Pacific Islander. While the APIA community has come a long way in terms of overcoming discrimination, fighting stereotypes,... having representation in sports, media, politics, business and various other areas of society, we still have a lot to learn from each other and ourselves. We still have a lot that we can accomplish. Every year, the Asian American Alliance at Columbia University hosts Crossroads leadership conference. All high school students are encouraged to apply. Delegates will work closely with student leaders at Columbia University. We hope to provide delegates with information, history, leadership skills, and a network of peers from which they can benefit from to become the next of generation of leaders.
