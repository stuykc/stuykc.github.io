We will be helping out at the 3rd Annual Summer Streets once again! Summer Streets spans three Sundays in August in which nearly seven miles of NYC's streets are closed to traffic. Along the route, there are six rest stops where people can participate in various activities, such as minigolf, rock climbing, bike rental, ziplining, performances, and much more! Volunteers will be helping out with traffic control, giving directions to participants, and also helping out with various activities at each rest stop. 

**We are participating in this event with both Red Cross and ARISTA! Please see the flyer [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxXqN5Z3C8HjM01tVHYyMnU3aWtnWm5ibjRwUUhHaEpOOVpv/view) for more information on the street locations.**
