You'll be working with the zone gardeners at Riverside Park and learn about planting, mulching, and weeding through hands on experience. Gloves and other supplies will be provided.

Info about attire: Dress comfortably and be prepared to get dirty! Remove any jewelry, tie your hair back, and wear closed toe shoes (required). There won't be a place to store your belongings so keep that in mind when packing your things the night before.
