As a division, we'll be watching [Catching Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951264/). Although this is a Key Club event, we'll be having fun watching the movie, so you will NOT be receiving hours for this. We still encourage you to come as you get to see this movie for a price lower than normal tickets! Ticket prices are $9 if you give it to us on monday (to a cabinet member, or during divisional) and $10 after that.

In addition, this is a divisional fundraiser and all proceeds will go to help those struck by Typoon Haiyan in the Philippines!
