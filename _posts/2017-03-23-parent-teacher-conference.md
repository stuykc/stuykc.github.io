ARISTA, Red Cross, and Key Club will be rewarding credits for volunteering for PTC. We will be helping teachers with checking parents under the same tab. Every students should received an email regarding volunteer registration for PTC in their stuy.edu email. Please log in and you may indicate which day you are interested in volunteering on. You may also indicate your preferences for the teacher you want to help. The only way to guarantee that you will be matched with the teacher is to ask them personally. They will received a separate interface where they will enter the students they want as monitors. Please indicate that you are a part of Key Club "Your Information" view.
