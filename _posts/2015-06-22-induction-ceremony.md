Come and celebrate the end of a wonderful service year with us! Hear speeches from the Old Cab, the New Cab, pig out on food, and receive your certificates as proof of your service! We will also be having some special member awards, so get hyped for that! As previously mentioned, everyone who has over 30 hours will receive a certificate of merit. Those who have served over 50 hours, will receive a more special certificate! We will be emailing a seating arrangement preferences for those who sign up so that you'll probably be sitting with people you like!
