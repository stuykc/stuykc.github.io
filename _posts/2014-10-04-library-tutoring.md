Stuyvesant Key Club works with the Stuyvesant Math Tutoring Squad for this weekly tutoring event. Every Saturday, Stuyvesant students from the different boroughs of New York City travel to a local New York Public Library, where they volunteer to tutor children in grades K-8. Just go to the location, find a group of Stuyvesant-looking students (there will probably be posters/signs), and tell them you're from Stuyvesant Key Club. If you sign up to be project captain, send us a PRF once a month with the cumulative hours! You will not need to submit a PRF every week!

####Tutoring at Flushing Library begins on October 25th. Working papers are required to volunteer at a Queens Library Branch.####
