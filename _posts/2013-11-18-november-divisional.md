Every month, the Key Clubs in Division 11 (basically all of the Manhattan/Bronx Key Clubs) gather together for a divisional where we discuss past events and upcoming initiatives. This month, it is conveniently located right in our school! Attending divisionals is a great way for you all to see Key Club outside of Stuyvesant. Therefore, we **highly** recommend that you come!
