This will be the next step in helping out our local communities in District 1. This time we will be teaming up with Chinatown Partnerships, the 7th Precinct, and Baruch volunteers to get rid of unwanted Graffiti in our local community. If you went to the last event, we would like to apologize because the power washers didn't come in time.

**If the temperatures on Sunday go below 50 degrees, we'll be planting tulips instead of cleaning up graffiti. In that case, we will be meeting at the Chinatown BID office at 60 St James Place.**
