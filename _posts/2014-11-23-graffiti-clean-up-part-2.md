This will be the next step in helping out our local communities in District 1. This time we will be teaming up with Chinatown Partnerships, the 7th Precinct, and Baruch volunteers to get rid of unwanted Graffiti in our local community. If you went to the last event, we would like to apologize because the power washers didn't come in time.
