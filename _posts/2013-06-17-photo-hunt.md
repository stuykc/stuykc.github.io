We'll be collecting $3 from each participant which will be donated to an organization that we choose later on. So this is a fun event and a fundraiser!  For the photo hunt, members will compete in teams of 3 or 4.

At the beginning of the event, each team will be given a list of clues that they will have to figure out in order to determine what they will have to take a picture of. Each picture will have to include at least 2 team members in them. We may also give you a map to show you the limits of how far you should go so you don't end up completely on the other side of Manhattan. We'll set a certain time limit and at the end, all the teams will come back to the park where the Cab members will look at the pictures on the cameras and count up how many you got right. The team with the most pictures taken will win and get a wonderful prize! :)
