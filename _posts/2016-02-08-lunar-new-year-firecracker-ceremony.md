Better Chinatown Society will be hosting their annual Lunar New Year celebrations will be held all throughout February this year!
On Monday, February 8 is the 17th Annual New Year Firecracker Ceremony and Cultural Festival. We will be helping Better Chinatown set up and run booths for organizations including Delta Air Lines, EmblemHealth, and McDonald's. What better way to spend your New Year's Day off than serving alongside friends and family?

We understand if you have family plans that day, so you may leave early if necessary.
