Concern will be having its 17th Annual Concern Spring Run in Central Park! In this 4 miles run, runners supporting Concern's fight against extreme poverty will be providing disadvantaged families with food, water, health care, and other resources. Come help out in this amazing cause, where we'll be cheering on runners, handing out water, and doing whatever other jobs the coordinator asks of us.
