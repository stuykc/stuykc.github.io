Please arrive by 7 AM and check in with coordinator Paul Nelson in the race festival area located on the 102nd Street Transverse. We will be marshalling on the course, serving water and Gatorade, setting up and maintaining bag check, or working at another station depending on how many Key Clubbers attend. Remember to dress warmly and comfortably and bring some food if you think you'll get hungry (although there will be bagels and fruit available) because we will be outside for a long time.
