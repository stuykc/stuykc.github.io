We plan on doing some educational outreach, including brochure and flyer distribution and balloon-animal making! The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will be holding a free hepatitis B screening at the same table as well, so there is be potential to help them out as well. Finally, this Saturday would be a great chance to show support to the Filipino community in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan.
