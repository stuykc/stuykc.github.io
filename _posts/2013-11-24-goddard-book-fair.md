Each year, the Goddard Riverside Community hosts a bookfair that brings readers of all ages from around the city. By selling these books at lower prices, Goddard not only gives the buyers a good deal, but also benefits the homeless people that Goddard donates the proceeds to. Come help Goddard with this cause by unpacking, sorting, selling and packing books, as well as helping people find a book that is right for them!
