Come to the first club meeting of the service year! We will be announcing the awards we got at LTC, recapping the LTC experience, introducing the new Cabinet, and discussing our new plans/goals for next year! A fun activity is scheduled for after all the updates are given, so make sure to come and be a part of the fun!

**We will also be rolling out/talking about committee head applications for this service year at this meeting, so be sure to come if you're interested in applying! If you don't even know what Committee Heads are, you should definitely come!**
