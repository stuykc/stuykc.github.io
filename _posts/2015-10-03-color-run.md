Color Run is a 5k, untimed race in which thousands of people, or “Color Runners”, are doused from head to toe in different colors at each kilometer. We'll be helping out at color stations, the finish line, water stations, etc. There will also be a festival area for you to enjoy after your shift! This is always one of our most popular events, so be sure to come if you can!
