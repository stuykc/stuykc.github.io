For the past few years. we've always held the Amazing Race, raising thousands of dollars for charity. Now is your chance to take part in the process! The application process consists of an online application along with an interview, and the deadline to apply is March 21st. Please do not wait until then! By being a part of the ARPC, you get to host one of the largest student-lead fundraisers in NYC. Furthermore, you'll learn the intricacies of events planning and gain a lot from that!
