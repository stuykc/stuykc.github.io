Help join the fight against Autism! It is 1.5 miles long. PLEASE READ: Their walk has a rolling start. This means walkers can enter any time from 9AM-12PM. Key Club will be entering at 10:30 (that's when opening ceremony starts), so wait at the start to find everyone. But if you get there late/early, and want to walk by yourself, go for it! **You can only enter with a special wristband.** So, register officially early, to ensure that they will mail me the wristbands in time, so I (Yee Gee) can give you the wristband some time before the event. Otherwise, the project captain will on the day of. **You cannot join the event if you don't register!**

**Sign up officially here:** [http://www.walknowforautismspeaks.org/faf/search/searchTeamPart.asp?ievent=1049125&team=5489954](http://www.walknowforautismspeaks.org/faf/search/searchTeamPart.asp?ievent=1049125&team=5489954)
