Stuyvesant hosts two Open House events where many many many people from all over the city come to see our amazing school! This year, the two dates are this Monday and Tuesday, and we need as much help as possible! Volunteers will be touring middle schoolers and their parents, answering any questions they may have, and also helping out with ushering and patrol on the first floor. Unfortunately, this event is limited to only sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Sorry freshmen! There will be plenty of other events you can take part of and you guys will be able to help out next year. THERE WILL ALSO BE FOOD SPONSORED BY THE PTA!

**ARISTA, Big Sibs, Key Club, and Red Cross will all be participating in this event, so be sure to check off all of the clubs you are a part of in one of the questions of the form. 
Before you guys even ask, YES you can sign up for multiple clubs/organizations and get hours from multiple clubs!
Please do not sign up more than once!**
