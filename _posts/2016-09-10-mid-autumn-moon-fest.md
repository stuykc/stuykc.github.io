We will be helping Chinatown Partnership and Chinatown BID with their next weekend walk! We will be helping Chinatown BID set up for the event. This involves setting up tents, tables, chairs, lanterns, the stage, and controlling traffic. This is a very popular event and in past years, volunteers got to take home free moon cakes.
