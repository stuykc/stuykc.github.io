We will be raising awareness for Hepatitis by holding signs and distributing flyers to people in Times Square. Then at 12, we'll participate in trying to break the Guinness World Record for the most people performing the "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" poses! These poses signify how Hepatitis has been largely ignored by individuals, communities and health organizations despite its prevalence in the world.
