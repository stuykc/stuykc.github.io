We will be helping Hopes & Heroes in this event. Hopes & Heroes's mission is to fund research for children with childhood cancer and blood disorders. To assist Hopes & Heroes with their walk, we will be helping out with registration, handing food & beverages for walkers, greeting, cheering, and much more!
