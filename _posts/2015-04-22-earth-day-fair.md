We'll be participating in Stuyvesant's annual Earth Day Fair! Key Club will be educating others on the water crisis and how our freshwater supplies are being contaminated by runoff from farms, industries, mines, and other locations. We will also be hosting a fun activity and selling food, so please come help out!
