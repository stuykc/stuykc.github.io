We'll be helping out at the 14th Annual Chinatown Beautification Youth Conference and the Clean up Day. At the Conference, youths will attend workshops that explore the themeâ€”Map Yourself: Navigating the Intersectons of Identity. Lunch and refreshments will also be provided! On the 21st, we will be sorted into groups with brooms, dustpans and garbage bags to show the Chinatown community we care and will also act as a reminder for people to take care of their community as we help beautify Chinatown.
