We'll be helping JCC Manhattan with their decorating and wrapping of donated presents to families receiving service from City Santa and Coalition for the Homeless. Volunteers should bring a roll of wrapping paper! If you don't have wrapping paper, we might be able to provide it. Sign up ASAP! Spots are filling up fast.
