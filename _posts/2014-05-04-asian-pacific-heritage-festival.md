We will be helping out Better Chinatown host the Asian Pacific Heritage Festival. There will be 2 groups of volunteers for both days. The first group of about 10 volunteers would help move supplies to the festival location from the office via trucks. Afterwards, they will be meeting up with Group 2 at PS 176. Group 2 would be at the location of the festival to help set up for the day of fun. This is a long event, especially for Group 1.  
**Please note that this is on the same day as MS Walk**
