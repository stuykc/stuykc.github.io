Over the past year, basic rights for women, immigrants, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, the religious and nonreligious, people of color and even Mother Earth have struggled to survive under the weight of the current administration. Americaâ€™s First Amendment has been challenged and healthcare for millions has been threatened. We must stand together to demand and defend our rights. Let your voice echo from the streets of New York City to the capital city. Show the world that red, white and blue are colors of tolerance.
Join the world! On January 20th NYC will raise its voice again to demand equality for all humans at the 2018 Womenâ€™s March on NYC.**THIS IS A DIVISION-WIDE EVENT!!!
