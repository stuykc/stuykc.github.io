Volunteers will be assisting with bag check-in, marshaling, etc! Depending on the situation, you might also become a cheerer! You get to cheer on the participants as they make their trek up the many stairs of Rockefeller Center. You will also most likely get to go to the top (for free!) at the end of everything and enjoy the amazing view!
