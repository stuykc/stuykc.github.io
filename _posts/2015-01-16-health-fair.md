 Come help out at the Key Club table(s) at the 5th Annual Health Fair! Yay!! The health issue we will be educating our visitors on is food-borne illnesses (food poisoning, E.Coli, Tapeworms, etc.) We will need volunteers to prepare and divvy out sushi, explain information to others, and ask trivia questions to others! *NOTE: This event in on the same day as the January Divisional so keep that in mind!*
We will be going shopping for supplies as a group next Thursday (1/16/15)! Please meet Sissi after 10th by the Key Club bulletin board! :D
