Come join us and help out at another successful weekend street fair in Chinatown.  There will be plenty of activities to help out such as the Giant Chess set, arts and crafts, games and a multitude of rides.  This street fair theme is water so come out and have some fun in the sun.  This event may or may not involve some heavy lifting.
