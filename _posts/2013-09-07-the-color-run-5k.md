The Color Run™, also known as the Happiest 5k on the Planet, is a unique paint race that celebrates healthiness, happiness, individuality, and giving back to the community. The run will raise money for the Global Poverty Project and various other national and local charities. Volunteers will be assigned to a color station and blast the runners with powdered color. Come on, how cool is that?

###Transportation:
- Those that will be driving will continue down Flatbush Avenue and enter in at Aviation Road to park.  There will be parking attendants to direct you, but please note that parking is limited and we expect quite a bit of traffic.
- If you will be taking the subway to Brooklyn College Stop, there are a couple of options. The Color Run™ will be providing free shuttles starting at 7:30 am. These shuttle buses will look like SCHOOL BUSES. You can also take city buses with your transfer from subway to bus. The shuttles will continue running to take you back until 1:30pm. Please BE CAREFUL about which shuttle you take. There may be some companies that will charge you, so just remember to look for The Color Run's SCHOOL BUS shuttles. *Please note that those arriving via subway and shuttles will arrive after the requested 7:00 time!*

When you arrive, look for the blue volunteer tent to check in. There will plenty of flags and signs to direct you.

###What to Wear / Bring:
- The Color Run T-shirt (provided upon arrival)
- Closed-toe shoes
- Clothes that you don't mind getting COLORFUL!
- Sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottle, snacks
