The Color Run™, also known as the Happiest 5k on the Planet, is a unique paint race that celebrates healthiness, happiness, individuality, and giving back to the community. The run will raise money for the Global Poverty Project and various other national and local charities. Volunteers will be assigned to a color station and blast the runners with powdered color. Come on, how cool is that?
