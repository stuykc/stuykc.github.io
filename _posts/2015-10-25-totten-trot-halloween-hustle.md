We have been invited to volunteer at the 14th Annual Totten Trot 5K Halloween Hustle Foot Race and Fun Run, benefiting the programs of the Bayside Historical Society. Jobs include manning water stations, crowd control, and giving out goodie bags. After the run, there will also be a Halloween party in the main building.
