Walk for Kids Growth increases awareness of childhood growth disorders, growth hormone deficiency and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Funds raised from Walk for Kids Growth will provide research, education, support, and patient advocacy. The walk officially begins at 1 PM, but we need to arrive at 11 AM to volunteer. We will be helping out with set up, assisting with stage presentations and vendors, and more.
