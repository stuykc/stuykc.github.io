Making Strides of Central Park is a divisional project supporting the American Cancer Society. This walk is to not only raise money to fund research for Breast Cancer, but also to support those that have suffered from or are currently suffering from breast cancer. For these reasons, this walk is extremely important and it would be great if you came to volunteer at this event!
