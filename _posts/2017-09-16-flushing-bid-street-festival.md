We will be helping out at the Annual Flushing Street Festival to display the rich, distinct culture that Main Street has to offer! There will be over 70 booths of food, shopping, as well as raffles and bounce houses. In addition, there is an orientation to inform volunteers and to distribute t-shirts. Extra hours will be given to those who attend the orientation. 
**SAME DAY AS BUDDY WALK AND THE MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL**
