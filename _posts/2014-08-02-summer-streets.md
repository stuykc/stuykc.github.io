The 2nd Annual Summer Streets is taking place on nearly seven miles of NYC streets closed to traffic.  People can enjoy biking and various activities at rest stops along the route.  We will be helping out with the various activities, directing participants and marshaling the route. **To volunteer you MUST attend a training session on Thursday July 31st, Thursday August 7th, OR Monday August 11th.** You will receive points for attending the session so make sure to sign out with leaders from Key Club, Red Cross or ARISTA. If you are definitely unable to attend email us but everyone is expected to go since the information is very important.
