Kick off the holiday season by volunteering at the annual Harvest Food Drive where you will help the Police Athletic League (PAL) pack non-perishable food items to families in need. You can also bring non-perishable food items as well to further contribute to the cause.

This event is capped to 10 volunteers, but don't let that number discourage you from signing up!
