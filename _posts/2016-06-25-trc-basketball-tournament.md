We'll be helping TRC with their annual Basketball Tournament. Volunteers will be helping out with various jobs based on their knowledge of basketball; however no experience is necessary! All volunteers will receive a free t-shirt and lunch. Please note your dietary restrictions on the form. In addition, all volunteers that attend the orientation held on June 15th will get extra hours!
