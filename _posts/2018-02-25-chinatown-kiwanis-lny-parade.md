Volunteers will be walking around with Chinatown Kiwanis in the annual Lunar New Year Parade. Youâ€™ll be a part of the parade! Similar to a walk, you will be representing Chinatown Kiwanis and Stuyvesant Key Club all while celebrating the New Year! Key Clubbers who were part of the event last year should bring their Kiwanis caps. And preferably all volunteers should wear your Key Club shirt!
