We will be volunteering at the annual Race for the Cure Breast Cancer walk for Susan G. Komen. This year we will be helping out as Course Marshalls. Further sign up instructions will be sent in a follow up email. This event is uncapped. If you sign up, please save the date, as it is a while away. Red Cross, ARISTA, and Key Club will all be doing this event, so select which club(s) you are a member of to receive your hours/credits. You only need to fill out this form once because all three clubs are using the same one.
