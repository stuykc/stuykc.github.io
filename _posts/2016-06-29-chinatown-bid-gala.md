Chinatown Partnership needs help in the upcoming dinner gala that will be happening at the Joy Luck Palace in Chinatown! We will be helping them hang up decorations, set up tables, and other small tasks. Those who attend this event must be able to stay for the whole time of their shifts (!!!), so please clear your schedules beforehand! There will be free dinner provided for those who stay for running the event!

Please <b>signup by 6/27</b> and <b>dress at LEAST business casual</b>! This is a nice formal party, so do not show up looking like a bum!
