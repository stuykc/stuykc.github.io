We'll be celebrating together for the holidays in teacher's cafeteria! The recommended donation is $10, but you're are only required to donate $5. We will have food of course (Subway sandwiches + assorted holiday snacks), raffles (!!!), and fun! There will be a variety of activities, including card-making for hospitalized children. You can also invite your friends who are not in Key Club to come since we will be doing charity work and will appreciate any additional help. You can also come pick up your membership items!!

Hope to see y'all there! Please sign up so we know how many people are coming!
