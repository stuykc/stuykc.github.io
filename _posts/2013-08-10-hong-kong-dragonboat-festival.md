The HKDBF is an annual sporting and multicultural event held to celebrate the fifth moon (or the fifth month) of the lunar calendar. In addition to providing audiences with traditional Chinese foods and performances, the festival hosts over 120 dragon boat teams from across North America, making it one of the largest dragon boat festivals in the United States. Volunteers can help out during the event with Team Registration, Docking, VIP, Arts and Crafts, Timekeeping, Parking, Press, Events Coordination, and Team Coordination!

**You will need to fill out [a volunteer waiver form](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1Zf93cWFtV-dYoTcXNPL-xlj2sggvv_XiYLUj3FQg1byPN-WbpICL9SJVNueD/edit) to be able to volunteer!**

###Transportation:
There will be volunteer buses leaving from the Sheraton LaGuardia Hotel (135-20 39th Ave Flushing, NY 11354) going to the festival site at 6:45, 7:15, and 7:45. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T MISS THE BUS. If you do happen to miss the buses, you'll need to take the [7 to Mets - Willets Point and then the special events bus to the festival site](http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/events/HongKongDragonBoatFestivalinFlushingMeadows2013.htm). We don't advise this option because this bus doesn't operate early in the morning and it will not drop you off directly in front of the volunteer tent, which will only make things confusing for you. **So, please try to get to the hotel on time to take the volunteer bus!** If you are coming later, there are volunteer buses at 12:45 and 1:15.  
When getting back from the festival site, there will be buses leaving from the festival site going to the hotel.

###Notes:
- Sign in with the festival staff at the volunteer tent when you get there! The project captain will also be there to sign you in for Key Club.
- Please wear a white shirt to identify ourselves as volunteers. Also, dress appropriately because you may be assigned a position near the water where you may get wet.
- Bring sunscreen! We don't want you guys to get sunburned out there! However, there won't be a place to store your bags, so try not to carry that much with you to the festival.
- There will be free lunch for all volunteers at 12 PM! :D
