We will be setting up before the event (setting chairs, tables, food, etc) and faciliating with other tasks during the event. We also need a photographer, preferably someone with a DSLR. He/she will need to take pictures and record the performances. We will be offering extra points for this position! There is a cap of 10 volunteers for this event so sign up!
