We'll be overseeing the 5K/15K Turkey Trot. Volunteers will helping out with water stations, course marshaling, registration, and more.  You will also receive a free t-shirt! This specific event supports Young Survival Coalition which is dedicated to critical issues unique to young women with breast cancer.
