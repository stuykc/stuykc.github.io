If any of you went to LTC, you might have seen the man selling fancy chic bracelets. Guess what? They've come to Stuy! The YUDA band is a band made by Guatemalan children to pay for their education. For every 175 sold, a child gets a whole year of education! The band is made of high quality leather and polished coconut shell and will match with any outfit! Please help and either volunteer by helping sell the bands or buy one yourself, or even do both!

**The price for each bracelet is $7.00.**
