It's that time of the year! The Division 11 movie fundraiser is back! This year we will be watching The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2! Join us at the AMC Loews Theater in Manhattan for a fun-filled Sunday, with other Key Clubbers and friends alike! It is highly recommended to pay before hand, and if you register, a reservation WILL be made for you. Please contact us before the day of the movie fundraiser if you cannot make it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask any one of the organizers (Kalvin Chi, Division 11 Executive Assistant '15-'16, Division 11 Events Committee Chair '15-'16 or Emily Li, our LTG)! 

**Tickets will be around $10 per person, and the exact time will be announced as the date gets closer.**
