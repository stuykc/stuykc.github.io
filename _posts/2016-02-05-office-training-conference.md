We will be giving presentations on what the various cabinet positions entail in terms of workload, responsibilities, etc. We highly encourage all underclassmen (Freshmen and Sophomores) to come as well! We want you guys to know what the Cabinet is in charge of doing, get more involved, and even run for office! See you all there!

**If you want to run for any cabinet position, you must attend, so come even if you are a little bit interested!!**
