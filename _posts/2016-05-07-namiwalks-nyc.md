In this annual event, we will once again be helping NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City) in the largest mental health walk in New York City. Possible tasks include Greeters: Greets running and walk participants once they enter the event grounds, Greets walkers as they return from walk, Food and Beverage: Hands out snacks and water to walk participants, Route Walker: Volunteers that walk with NAMI Walkers along the route, keeping an eye on everyone and being helpful towards our walkers, and Selfie Station Volunteers: Volunteers who deal with taking pictures of walkers.
