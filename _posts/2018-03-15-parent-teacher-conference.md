We'll be helping out teachers at PTC! All students should have received an email regarding volunteer registration for PTC in their stuy.edu emails. Upon logging in, you should indicate that you are part of Key Club under "Your Information" in order to receive hours. If you're planning on helping out a specific teacher, you should request them on the website.
