We'll be joining Stuy Amnesty Club at the annual Pride March to make your voice heard! When you volunteer for PRIDE, you'll join 300,000 other activists from around the country who believe in human rights for all people- regardless of sexual orientation. Help us continue to grow the movement for human rights for everyone!
