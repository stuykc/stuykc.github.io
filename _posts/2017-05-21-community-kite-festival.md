The Festival features kite-decorating and flying, live music and entertainment, field day activities, and more. This year our focus is promoting healthy and active kids by encouraging field day activities such as relay races, sports, and various physical challenges. Volunteers are needed to face paint, oversee relay races and tug of war, assist in ring toss games, manage lines for the bouncy houses, play basketball, sell bubbles, chalk, and frisbees, help children decorate their kites, and most of allâ€”wear a huge smile while helping children enjoy their day at the park!
