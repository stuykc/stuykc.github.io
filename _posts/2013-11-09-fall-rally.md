Each year the lieutenant governors get together to host a Fall Rally, a day in which thousands of key clubbers from around NYC gather to bond, have fun, and learn more about Key Club. These will be done through workshops which will also include teaching essential skills such as public speaking and resume-building. Fall Rally is truly an amazing experience and we highly encourage you to attend! Also, RSVP on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/588801154500330/)!
