Fall Rally is one of Key Club's largest conventions of the year. On this day, thousands of key clubbers from around NYC gather to bond, have fun, and learn more about Key Club. Not only that, there will also be workshops that teach you essential skills such as public speaking and resume-building. It's an amazing experience and we highly encourage you to attend! Also, RSVP on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/588801154500330/)!
