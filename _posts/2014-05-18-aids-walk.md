OUR BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR!!! You know the drill; we will once again be participating in the biggest walk of the year! You must register online for our team if you wish to attend! Since the walk is 6+ miles long and there will be a lot of walking, we will be giving extra hours, anywhere from 8 to 10 hours total. If you still haven't reached your minimum of 30 hours, you should come!

**You must also sign up here!  Press Join a team, select Stuyvesant Key Club, and fill out the form**
