This will be our first divisional of the 2017-2018 school year! We will be having fun activities for new members and old members to learn more about Key Club and get to hear some updates from the divisional board and clubs. This is a form you should fill out if you want to meetup before we go. Make sure you signed up for the divisional first! You will receive hours for coming. It's a great way to meet people from around the city!
