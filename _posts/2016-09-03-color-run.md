Color Run is a 5k, un-timed race in which thousands of people, or “Color Runners”, are doused from head to toe in different colors at each station. We'll be helping out at color stations, the finish line, festival area, water stations, etc. Although this event is still some time away, <b>volunteer spots fill out extremely early</b> every year, so please sign up ahead of time if you are planning to go.
