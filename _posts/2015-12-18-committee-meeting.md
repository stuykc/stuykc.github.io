The Art, Fundraising, and Web/Video Committees will be meeting together in the same room! The **Art Committee** will be redecorating the Key Club bulletin board to make it more festive, perfect for the upcoming holidays seasons! We recently went on a shopping trip at Michael's, so there are lots of new supplies we can decorate with! The **Fundraising Committee** will be planning a fundraiser that will take place over winter break. The **Web/Video Committee** will be taking care of introductions and start talking about how the website works.

**At the end of this meeting, the three committees will be building a gingerbread house and eating it! Come if you think this sounds like fun!**
