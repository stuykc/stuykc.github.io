LTC stands for Leadership Training Conference, known in other states as the Key Club DCONs (District Conventions). LTC is a chance to get a full Key Club experience and get a glimpse at how big Key Club really is. Like other years, LTC will be hosted at the Desmond Hotel in Albany (we will be going to the hotel via coach bus, so don't worry about having to drive to Albany) from March 18-20, along with hundreds of Key Clubbers from all over New York! THIS IS THE BIGGEST, FUNNEST, BESTEST EVENT OF THE YEAR!
