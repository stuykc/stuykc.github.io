We will first be marching with Chinatown Partnership/Chinatown BID in the parade, before helping them pass out flyers advertising the weekend walk on July 26th (the ADA birthday party celebration, which you can sign up to volunteer for [here](http://goo.gl/forms/XVfpBkR4eU)).

**This event is on the same day as the Bastille Day event!**
