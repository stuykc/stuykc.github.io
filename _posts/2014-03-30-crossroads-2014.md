Crossroads are meetings of different paths. In this day and age, our identities are more complicated than they may at first seem to be. They intersect, they complicate, they elaborate. In the past, our identities have been used against us, to close us off, to lock us into roles that we never wanted to accept in the first place. Itâ€™s time for us to break down our walls. Asian Americans are loud, political, and powerful. We speak with voices united in meaning, if not in language. This year, the Crossroads conference seeks to reach out and over the limitations that have been imposed upon us. We want to add new voices to the conversations that are already happening all around us.
