Once again, we will be helping Chinatown Partnership and Chinatown B.I.D. with their next weekend walk! This time, the event is a Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, celebrating love in Chinatown. We will be helping Chinatown BID set up for the event. This involves setting up tents, tables, chairs, lanterns, the stage, and controlling traffic. Although the event ends at 6pm, you are welcome to stay and enjoy the food for sale! Vendors include Samâ€™s Fried Ice Cream, Osaka Grub, Seoul Pancake, Karl's Balls, and Rice and Chopsticks. Please invite all your friends to come to this popular event as well!
